National surveys are the methods of publishing the summary of economic activities of a country.
so many people are coming for that and to be like taht
National accounting is the method of expressing all the economic activities of a nation in a nutshell.
In any economic process where scarcity exists, related conditions and matters to be considered are commonly applied, irrespective of the fact whether they depend on the market or not.
In any economic process where scarcity is in existence,  related terms and considered matters are generally applied,whether it is market dependent or not.
Original essay: Economic methods
Macro economics have been reflected in the writings of:traditional economics,Keynesian economics,new-Keynesian philosophy,post-Keynesian economics,financial economics,new-traditional economics and supply based economics.
Those in whose literature macro economics was reflected: Classical economics, Keynesian economics, neo Keynesian economics, neo Keynesian thoughts, post Keynesian economics, financial economics, neo classical economics and supply based economics.
in spite of that they look for that and want to have that for which they look for and aspires according to the situations, but the dependancy also is very must to maintain in every sector
In conducting many economic experiments in the applied field: experimental economics and consumer behavior, highlighting human issues in experiments and branches of econometric, testing of missing data through controlled experiments are included.
In conducting the economic experiments in many practical fields; experimental economics and behavior of consumers,keeping in view the humane matters in experiments; and branches of econometrics,through controlled experiments over viewing the absent datum research are included.
Sometimes empirical testing of this 'accepted principle' can be the subject of selfless principle when all the social pressures are considered or processing according to own choice takes place.
If one logical man is not unselfish then another person can be selfish for eternity.
Sometimes this ""accepted principles"" may be the subject matter of various experiments and even that of unselfish morality, when all the social pressure are considered or developed in the shape of individual likings.

For example, for an electrical engineer whose area is VLSI (IC design work), the Quantum force science and the Solid State Physics is very important; but a person who works with bigger scale electrical equipments these are not at all important for him.
As example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics are very useful for those whose work field is VLSI (the design of integrated circuits) but these are useless for those working on electrical tools for large machineries.
For example,an electrical engineer whose area of work is VLSI (integrated circuit or IC designing) requires knowledge of quantum mechanics and solid state physics in day to day affairs while one who works with large sized electrical equipments not at all need them.
For example,an electrical engineer whose sphere of work is VLSI(mixed circuit or IC designing work) quantum ball science and hard temperament physics are always necessary but it is totally unnecessary for someone who works with large electrical machinery.
In the work field the electrical engineers often have to supervise the work of scientists, electricians, computer programmer or other technicians of different occupations.

Sometimes what is being stated in other social sciences on the same issue, it becomes difficult for the economists to conduct regular experiments in standard and practical aspects of human related issues.
Sometimes it becomes difficult for the economists to examine regularly the humane related principles and utilization in the face of the viewpoints of other social sciences on the same subject.
Propensity to increase income = consumption: It is treated as an accepted principle and many mainstream economists think that men are happy with consumption and unhappy without it.
Sometimes this accepted first principle is a subject of various tests and also a subject of the unselfish first principle, when all social pressures are considered or when reaction to self desire is calculated.
......Tendency of increase of income = Appropriations: It may be considered as an accepted principle and many mainstream economists believe that human beings are happy when they enjoy and unhappy without enjoyment.
As an example, in 21st century US democracy make it possible to combine the development process, the contribution of Karl Marx in 19th century or the cold war upon the debate of capitalism vs socialism is a considerable subject of economics.
As examples, US made   the developmental activities of the republic possible in the 21st century, the contribution of Karl Marx, or the cold war involving the controversy between the capitalism and socialism, are matters of discussion of economics
As an example it can be stated that in 21st century US democracy enabled synchronization of development process, in 19th century contribution of Karl Marx or the cold war around the debate of socialism versus capitalism is the subject of economics.
The early assumption of human consumption is that when one decides on buying, then he definitely will consider the humanitarian ground and the environment, and also the monetary and business economics.
to maintain the lifestyle nothing is good and nothing is bad they think like this
The previous presumptions for humane consumptions are that a person must take into consideration the humane and environmental ideas when deciding to buy and apart from that also consider economic and commercial principles.

Social science is an observational science or sometime science, and a subject of controversy in the twentieth century.
For issues that are not able to satisfy other assumed conditions can be added which never can satisfy human beings.
Tendency of income increase = Consumption can be considered as an agreed first principle and many mainstream economist maintain this belief that human species are happy in consumption and unhappy when denied consumption
Other general hypothetical terms of the subject that not capable of making happy may be added which are never be able to make human being happy.
Still, economics do not create any cost complaint, so it may be a cause that, economics forecast without relying on observation-based research and a corollary examination.
Apart from these, economics does not make any complaint regarding the price, as a result, it may be one of the reasons that economics forecasts without any observational research or experimentations
Even after that economics does not create any price attack and it may be a cause that economics gives forecasts without observational research and empirical verification.
On the other hand, logical limited distribution of wealth fulfils the gap of an aspect of general welfare and economics
but the king of that time felt that his people are misusing himand they
On the other hand, distribution of reasonable limited resources fulfills the shortage in general welfare and in one of the economic field.
