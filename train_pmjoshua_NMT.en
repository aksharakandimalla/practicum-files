I thank the President of ECOSOC for inviting me to address the special meeting today to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Economic and Social Council.
On this occasion, I extend my sincere greetings and congratulations to all members of United Nations.
The ECOSOC is a key pillar of the United Nations structure.
Its creation as a distinct part of United Nations is a testimony to the centrality of development in the vision of the founders of the UN.
To achieve a peaceful and prosperous world, we need to put in place, first and foremost, conditions for rapid socio-economic development; improvement in the human condition, and an end to hunger and deprivation.
India was a proud participant in the creation of this body.
An eminent citizen of India, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar, was a key architect of ECOSOC.
He had the privilege of serving as the first President of ECOSOC at its inaugural session in 1946.
In his opening address to the ECOSOC’s first session, Ramaswamy defined what he saw was the role ECOSOC had to play in subsequent years.
70 years have passed since this body was created.
We are now 15 years into the 21st century.
But has the ECOSOC managed to fulfill the expectations of our founders?
It is also the most important unfulfilled objective of the United Nations.
The 70th anniversary of the ECOSOC could not have come at a more appropriate moment.
The international community has just given to itself a new comprehensive vision of development.
The ‘2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, presents a valuable opportunity for the UN system to rethink its role and purpose, and make itself more effective.
It is now the responsibility of ECOSOC to rise up to this challenge and contribute to making this Agenda a success.
The 2030 Agenda is a reflection of the challenges faced by poorer countries.
The developed countries on the other hand, face enormous responsibilities to rapidly move their economies on to a sustainable path, follow sustainable lifestyles and assist developing countries with finance and technologies.
At the same time, we have enormous resources at our command.
And technology today presents us with solutions that were unthinkable earlier.
The challenge is to channel the available resources and use technology to tackle the most urgent problems facing us.
I urge you to see this as an opportunity.
To rejuvenate the Council, to make it more action oriented, policy relevant and more responsive to the needs and aspirations of our people.
In doing so, the guiding philosophy of the ECOSOC must always be the welfare of the poorest of the poor, or ‘Antyodaya’ in Indian thought.
So long as there is poverty in the world, so long as our people, no matter in which country, remain deprived of basic human amenities, freedoms, rights and opportunities, the work of the ECOSOC will not be complete.
Following is the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s departure statement prior to attending the G-20 Summit.
“I will be visiting Buenos Aires from 29 November -01 December 2018 to attend the 13th G-20 Summit hosted by Argentina.
The G-20 seeks to promote multi-faceted cooperation among the twenty largest economies of the world.
Through the ten years of its existence, G-20 has strived to promote stable and sustainable global growth.
I look forward to meeting leaders from other G-20 countries to review the work of G-20 in the last ten years of its existence and chart the ways and means to meet the new and upcoming challenges of the coming decade.

His Excellency Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka
Secretary General of ITU,
Other distinguished dignitaries
I welcome you to New Delhi, for the Global Conference on Cyber Space.
I also welcome all those who are joining this event remotely from across the world, over the internet.
We all know how cyberspace has transformed the world over the last few decades.
The senior generation among the gathering here, would recall the bulky mainframe computer systems of the seventies and eighties.
A lot has changed since then.
Email and personal computers brought about a new revolution in the nineties.
Expressions such as the Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence, have now become commonplace.
These indicate that change continues, perhaps at an even faster pace now.
These rapid developments in the digital domain have mirrored immense change in India as well.
Indian IT talent has been recognized worldwide.
Indian IT companies have made a name for themselves globally.
Today, digital technology has emerged as a great enabler.
It has paved the way for efficient service delivery and governance.
It is improving access, in domains from education to health.
And it is helping to shape the future of business and economy.
Through each of these ways, it provides the less privileged sections of society, a more level playing field.
On a macro-scale, it has contributed to emergence of a flat world, where a developing nation like India can compete on a level footing with developed nations.
Technology breaks barriers.
We believe it validates the Indian philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” – the world is one family.
This expression reflects our ancient, inclusive traditions.
Through technology, we are able to give meaning to this expression, and indeed to the best of democratic values.
We in India, give primacy to the human face of technology, and are using it to improve what I call, “ease of living.”
Empowerment through digital access, is an objective that the Government of India is especially committed to.
“Digital India” is the world’s largest, technology-led transformative programme which is paving the way for our citizens to avail digital services.
We are using mobile power or M-power to empower our citizens.
I am sure most of you are already aware of Aadhaar, which is the unique biometric identity of a person.
We have used this identity to liberate our people from queues and cumbersome processes.
Three factors: first, financial inclusion through our Jan-Dhan bank accounts; second, the Aadhaar platform; and third, the Mobile phone, have greatly helped reduce corruption.
We call this the J.A.M. or JAM trinity.
Through better targeting of subsidies, the JAM trinity has prevented leakages to the tune of nearly 10 billion dollars so far.
Let me share a few examples of how digital technology is becoming a great facilitator for “ease of living.”
Today, a farmer can access a variety of services, such as soil-testing results, expert advice, and a good price for his produce, at the click of a button.
Digital technology is therefore contributing to increased farm incomes.
As he expands his business, he also contributes to lowering the cost of procurement for Government.
This leads to increased efficiency, and greater value for public money.
Pensioners no longer need to present themselves in front of a bank officer, to provide proof of life.
Today, a pensioner can leverage the Aadhaar biometric platform, to provide this proof with minimal physical effort.
Women form a significant part of the IT workforce.
Digital technology has facilitated several new enterprises led by women.
In this way the IT sector has contributed towards gender empowerment.
Citizens of India are increasingly adopting cashless transactions.
For this, we created the Bharat Interface for Money – or BHIM App.
This App is helping the movement towards a less cash and corruption free society.
These examples show the power of technology in improving governance.
We are using the digital domain to facilitate participative governance, or Jan Bhagidari.
When we assumed office in May 2014, many people, particularly youngsters expressed a keen desire to share their ideas and work for the nation.
It is our firm belief that there are millions of Indians, whose transformative ideas can go a long way in taking India to new heights.
Therefore, we launched the citizen engagement portal, MyGov.
This platform enables citizens to share their thoughts and ideas on important issues.
In many key policy areas, we received thousands of valuable suggestions.
Many logo and emblem designs for various Government initiatives today, are the result of crowd-sourcing, and competitions on MyGov.
In fact, even the official app for the Prime Minister’s Office, is the result of a competition floated on MyGov, which received brilliant responses from youngsters.
MyGov is a prime example of how technology strengthens democracy.
Let me turn to another example.
PRAGATI, in Hindi, literally means progress.
On the last Wednesday of every month, I meet top Union and State government officials for a PRAGATI Session.
Technology breaks silos.
Sitting in our respective offices, aided by the cyber world, we discuss and resolve important governance issues.
I am happy to share with you that the PRAGATI sessions have resulted in faster decision-making, through consensus, in the larger interest of the nation.
PRAGATI has put back on track infrastructure projects worth billions of dollars which were stuck in red-tape.
I have even tried something of my own, through the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
This App deepens my connect with citizens.
The suggestions I get through the App are very useful.
We shall be happy to share our experiences and success stories with the global community.
On the other hand, India is keen to find scalable models and innovative solutions in education and health, using digital technology.
We also wish to make cyberspace an enabler for the differently-abled.
Recently, during a thirty six hour Hackathon, college students suggested solutions to chronic problems that were put forward by Ministries.
We look forward to learn from global experiences and best practices.
We believe that growth happens only when we all grow together.
Cyberspace remains a key area for innovation.
Our startups today, are looking to provide solutions to common everyday problems, and improving the lives of people.
I am confident that the global investor community, will recognize the immense potential waiting to be tapped from India’s startup pool.
The internet, by nature, is inclusive and not exclusive.
It offers equity of access, and equality of opportunity.
Today’s discourse is being shaped by Facebookers, Tweeples, and Instagrammers.
Social media platforms are making cyberspace participative for all.
News that experts tell us from studios, is now supplemented by experiences highlighted on social media.
This transition, to a blend of expertise and experience, is the contribution of the cyber world.
Alertness towards cyber-security concerns, should become a way of life.
One of the major focus areas should be the training of well-equipped and capable professionals to counter cyber threats.
Cyber-warriors who will remain on the alert against cyber-attacks.
The term “hacking” may have acquired an exciting, even if dubious overtone.
We need to ensure that cyber protection becomes an attractive and viable career option for the youth.
On a related note, nations must also take responsibility to ensure that the digital space does not become a playground for the dark forces of terrorism and radicalization.
Information sharing and coordination among security agencies is essential to counter the ever-changing threat landscape.
Surely, we can walk the fine balance between privacy and openness on one hand, and national security on the other.
Together, we can overcome the differences between global and open systems on one hand, and nation-specific legal requirements on the other.
Emerging digital technologies could impact our future in ways that we cannot yet foresee.
Important questions of transparency, privacy, trust and security may need to be addressed.
Digital technology serves to empower mankind.
We must ensure that it continues to stay that way.
The large multi-stakeholder participation at this event, is proof of the global endorsement that this platform has received.
Nation states, the industry, academia and civil society, all need to work towards a formal collaborative framework.
This will enable a secure cyberspace which improves quality of life.
This conference is perhaps the biggest ever such event in terms of numbers.
I am told that all the background and logistics have been handled digitally.
I hope delegates from around the world found it a smooth and seamless experience.
I conclude by wishing you fruitful and productive deliberations and outcomes.

The salient features of the scheme are:-
(v). The Government will issue bonds with a rate of interest to be decided by the Government.
The rate of interest will take into account the domestic and international market conditions and may vary from one tranche to another.
This rate of interest will be calculated on the value of the gold at the time of investment.
(vi). The bonds will be available both in demat and paper form.
(vii). The bonds will be issued in denominations of 5,10,50,100 grams of gold or other denominations.

Your Excellency Dr. Ashraf Ghani, President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
Honourable Ministers
A famous poet of Persia, Hafez once said:
Today, we are all witnessing creation of history.
Today, we seek to fulfil it.
We are grateful to Excellency Rouhani for hosting this unique event.
Thank you President Ashraf Ghani, for your presence.
It truly holds a special significance.
It is a privilege to be here.
Excellency Rouhani, President Ghani and I have just held detailed discussions on a range of issues.
The agenda for economic engagement is a clear priority for us.
We stand together in unity of our purpose.
To carve out new routes of peace, and prosperity is our common goal.
We want to link with the world.
But, better connectivity among ourselves is also our priority.
It is indeed a new dawn for the region.
Iran, Afghanistan and India are deeply aware of the richness and reality of our ancient links.
Through centuries, art and culture, ideas and knowledge, language and traditions have formed a common bond between us.
Even through turmoil of history, our societies never lost touch with each other.
Today, we meet to write new chapters in our engagement.
The corridor would spur unhindered flow of commerce throughout the region.
The key arteries of the corridor would pass through the Chahbahar port of Iran.
It’s very location, on the mouth of Gulf of Oman, is of great strategic significance.
Afghanistan will get an assured, effective, and a more friendly route to trade with the rest of the world.
The arc of economic benefit from this agreement would extend beyond our three nations.
And, help us to eventually build what we all desire and deserve – a friendly and healthy neighbourhood.
The world around us is changing in fundamental ways.
And, the lack of comprehensive connectivity is not the only challenge that limits our national growth.
Global economy is yet to fully come out of uncertainty and weakness.
Our present growth and future prosperity is under threat from the spread of radical ideas and physical terror.
Amidst this landscape, our three countries are blessed with the most potent resource—our youth.
Our three nations are estimated to have more than 60 percent of their population under 30 years of age.
They are an asset in our national and regional development.
Its success will be a positive vote for peace and stability in the region.
It is my strong belief that trade and transit routes should only be a starting point of our journey to greater connectivity.
In my vision, the full spectrum of connectivity agenda between Iran, Afghanistan and India should span:
• from culture to commerce;
• from traditions to technology;
• from Investments to IT;
• from people to politics.
In a way, it is a pledge to:
• Realize the imperative of better connectivity;
• Establish peace and create stability;
• Build economic prosperity and engineer new trade ties;
• Break barriers and spread sweetness of familiarity among our people.
History will look back at this effort with nothing but approval and admiration.
I compliment Excellencies Rouhani and Ghani for their leadership in guiding this effort.
Thank you all.
Thank you very much.

The Prime Minister will launch Tuberculosis Free India Campaign on this occasion.
TB free India Campaign will take the activities of National Strategic Plan for TB elimination forward in Mission mode.
The new NSP adopts a multi-pronged approach which aims to ‘Detect’ all TB patients with an emphasis on reaching TB patients seeking care from private providers and undiagnosed TB in high-risk populations,
The Central University would be mentored by an existing Central University till its governing structure is in place.
The Rt. Hon’ble Mr. K.P. Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of Nepal, is on a State visit to India from April 6-8, 2018, at the invitation of the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi.
On April 7, 2018, the two Prime Ministers comprehensively reviewed the entire spectrum of multifaceted ties between the two countries.
They welcomed the growing partnership between the two governments, private sector and at the people’s level.
The two Prime Ministers resolved to work together to take bilateral relations to newer heights on the basis of equality, mutual trust, respect and benefit.
Recalling that the close and friendly India-Nepal relations are built on the strong foundation of shared historical and cultural links and close people to people contacts, the two Prime Ministers underscored the importance of regular high-level political exchanges in cementing bilateral ties.

The two Prime Ministers inaugurated the Integrated Check Post at Birgunj in Nepal.
Written in Kufic script, this manuscript is a prized possession of the Ministry of Culture’s Rampur Raza Library.
Governor of Manipur, Dr. Najma Heptullah,
They all made out-standing contributions to Indian science and education.
Let us also join the world to mourn the death of one of the greatest physicists of our time, Stephen Hawking – one of the brightest stars of modern cosmology.
He was a friend of India and had visited our country twice.
The common man knows Hawking’s name, not because of his work on black holes, but because of his unusually high commitment and spirit against all odds.
He will be remembered as one of the world’s greatest motivators of all time.
I am happy to be here in Imphal today, on the occasion of the one hundred and fifth session of the Indian Science Congress.
I am delighted to be among scientists, whose work paves the way for a better tomorrow.
I am also pleased to see Manipur University hosting this important event.
The University is emerging as an important center of higher education in the North-East.
I am told, that this is just the second time in over a century that the Indian Science Congress is being held in the North-East.
This is a testimony to the resurgent spirit of the North East.
It bodes well for the future.
Science has been synonymous with progress and prosperity from time immemorial.
Science is after all, but a means to a far greater end – of making a difference in the lives of others, of furthering human progress and welfare.
I stand here today, in this brave land of Manipur, where in April 1944 Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s INA gave the clarion call for freedom.
When you leave Manipur, I am sure you will also carry the same spirit of dedication to do something ever-lasting for our nation.
I am also sure you will continue to work closely with the scientists you have met here.
After all, effective solutions to big problems of science and technology, also require close cooperation and coordination among scientists across diverse streams.
The Union Government has initiated several new programs for the North-Eastern States, in the area of science.
We are now working to expand this network to all districts of the North-East.
Several new centers are bringing relevant science and technology to the North-East.
An “Ethno Medicinal Research Centre“ has been set up in Manipur.
This will undertake research on the wild herbs available in the North Eastern region, which have unique medicinal and aromatic properties.
State Climate Change Centers have been set up in seven North-Eastern States.
They will undertake risk analysis, and raise public awareness about climate change.
We have freed “bamboo” from being treated as a ‘Tree’ species, and classified it as a “Grass,” which it scientifically is.
For this, we changed a decades old law.
This amendment will allow for the free movement of bamboo.
It will ensure that the production and consumption centers are seamlessly integrated.
It will make farmers realize the true potential from the entire value chain in the bamboo ecosystem.
Government is also revamping the National Bamboo Mission with an outlay of Rs. 1200 crore.
States like Manipur will benefit from this decision.
The Indian Science Congress has a rich legacy.
It has been led by some of India’s tallest scientists, such as Acharya J.C. Bose, C.V. Raman, Meghnad Saha and S.N. Bose.
New India, should seek inspiration from the high standards of excellence, set by these great scientists.
During our interactions on various occasions, I have exhorted our scientists to seek solutions to our socio economic problems.
I have urged them to take up new challenges to benefit the poor and deprived sections of society.
The roads made using this method are more durable, water resistant and load bearing.
At the same time he has found a constructive use for the ballooning problem of plastic waste.
Chintakindi Mallesham was given a Padma Shri in 2017, for inventing the Laxmi ASU Machine which significantly reduced the time and labour required to weave Sarees.
The Session’s theme also raises some questions.
Have we done enough to ensure that children in India are sufficiently exposed to science?
Are we giving them a conducive environment to develop their inherent talent?
Our scientific achievements need to be actively communicated to the society.
We have to throw open our national institutions and laboratories to our children.
I call upon scientists to develop an appropriate mechanism for interaction with school-going children.
I also urge them, to spend 100 hours every year, with 100 students of Classes 10, 11 and 12 discussing various aspects of science and technology.
India is a leader in the multi-country International Solar Alliance and in Mission Innovation.
These groupings are providing a thrust to R&D for clean energy.
The Department of Atomic Energy is setting up ten new domestic Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors of 700 Mega Watt capacity each.
This is a major boost to the domestic nuclear industry.
It strengthens India’s credentials as a major nuclear manufacturing nation.
We are making concerted efforts to achieve complete elimination of TB from India.
This has been made possible through the hard work and dedication of Indian Scientists.
After the success of Chandrayan-1 we plan to launch Chandrayan-2 in the coming months.
This fully indigenous effort will include landing and travel on the surface of the moon by a rover.
The greatest scientist of the last century, Albert Einstein had given the theory about “gravitational waves”.
It is a matter of immense pride for all of us that 37 Indian scientists from nine Indian institutions participated in the international Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) Collaboration and proved this theory correct three years ago.
Our Government has already given approval to establish third LIGO detector in the country.
It will expand our knowledge in basic Sciences in the areas of lasers, light waves, and computing.
I am told that our scientists are tirelessly working towards making this a reality.
I have talked about developing Clusters of Excellence in Science in Cities, around important Scientific Institutions.
The objective is to create city-based R&D Clusters, which will bring together all Science and Technology partners, from Academia to Institutes, to Industries to Startups.
This will help promote new discoveries, and create globally competitive vibrant research hubs.
We have recently approved a new “Prime Minister’s Research Fellows” scheme.
Under this Scheme, bright minds from the best Institutions in the country, namely, IISc, IIT, NIT, IISER and IIIT will be offered direct admission in Ph.D. Programme in IIT and IISc.
This scheme will help address the brain-drain from our country.
It will go a long way in promoting indigenous research in cutting-edge Science and Technology domains.
We need science and technology to help us make India clean, green and prosperous.
Let me re-iterate some of my expectations from scientists.
A large section of our tribal population is affected by सिकलसेलअनीमिया.
Can our Scientists come up with a simple, cost-effective solution to this problem in the near future?
A large proportion of our children are affected by malnutrition.
To address this problem, the Government of India has launched the National Nutrition Mission.
Your suggestions and solutions can help us meet the objectives of the Mission.
India requires crores of new houses.
We have set a target of having 100 Giga Watts of installed solar power by 2022.
Efficiency of solar modules currently available in the markets around 17% to 18%.Can our scientists take a challenge to come up with a more efficient solar module, which can be produced in India at the same cost?
Imagine the resources we will be saving on this account.
ISRO uses one of the best battery systems to run satellites in space.
Other institutions can partner with ISRO to develop cost effective and efficient battery systems for mobile phones and electric cars.
We need to develop new procedures, medicines, and vaccines to get rid of silent killers like Malaria and Japanese Encephalitis.
Research should also be conducted in Yoga, sports, and traditional knowledge disciplines.
Small and medium scale industry units have been the main-stay for employment generation.
With global competition, they are facing increasing challenges.
Can our scientific and technological institutions take up the cause of the MSME sector and assist these units in improving processes and products?
Technology will allow far greater penetration of services such as education, healthcare, and banking to our citizens.
Four years from now, we will be celebrating the 75th year of our Independence.
This goal requires whole-hearted contribution from each one of you.
The Indian economy is on a high growth trajectory.
But we rank low in Human Development Indicators.
One of the important reasons for this in-consistency is major inter-state and intra-state disparity.
To address this, we have launched a concerted effort to improve the performance of over 100 Aspirational Districts.
We shall focus on important sectors such as Health and Nutrition; Education; Agriculture and Water Resources; Financial Inclusion; Skill Development; and Basic Infrastructure.
All these sectors require innovative solutions, which cater to local challenges and requirements.
The “one size fits all” approach cannot work in this case.
Can our Scientific Institutions serve these Aspirational Districts?
Can they catalyze creation and diffusion of appropriate technologies that generate skills and entrepreneur-ship?
This would be a great service to Mother India.
India has a rich tradition and a long history of both discovery and use science and technology.
It is time to reclaim our rightful place among the front-line nations in this field.
I call upon the scientific community to extend its research from the labs, to the land.
I am confident that through the dedicated efforts of our scientists, we are embarking on the road to a better future.
This shall also help in safeguarding human life, livestock and property.
The Bill provides for constitution of a National Committee on Dam Safety which shall evolve dam safety policies and recommend necessary regulations as may be required for the purpose.
The Bill provides for establishment of National Dam Safety Authority as a regulatory body which shall discharge functions to implement the policy, guidelines and standards for dam safety in the country.
India is a founder member of the International Labour Organization (ILO), which came into existence in 1919.
The principal means of action in the ILO is the setting up of International standards in the form of Conventions, Recommendations and Protocol.
India has so far ratified 45 Conventions, out of which 42 are in force.
Today, the world over, Christians are observing Easter.
I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.
Some of my young friends must be busy with their examinations.
Some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now.
For those of you who still have examinations, it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and T-20 Cricket World Cup on the other.
I am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between India and Australia this evening.
Some days ago India won two fine matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The Indian Football team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, and came fourth in the 1956 Olympics.
Unfortunately, over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs.
Today our ranking in FIFA is so low that I feel reluctant even to mention it.
On the other hand, I have been noticing that interest in Football among the youth in India has been rising – be it the English Premier League, Spanish League or the Indian Super League matches.
Young Indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television.
What I mean to say is, given this rising popular interest in Football and the opportunity of hosting FIFA Under-17 World Cup, shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility?
Or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports?
We should create an atmosphere of Football, Football, Football all around for this whole year – in schools, colleges, indeed, all over India.
We can see all this happening in relation to cricket; we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well.
Can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity?
I view the FIFA event as a great opportunity to establish India as a brand at a global level.
I consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of India’s youth power – not in the sense of winning or losing a match.
In the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 FIFA event, we can harness and display our many strengths; while doing so, we can do image-branding for India as well.
I look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup which you can send me through NarendraModiApp.
My dear students, you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays.
There are very few people who go abroad; most people visit places within their own states for a week or so.
Some people also go outside their states.
Last time too, I had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit.
And I have noticed that the kind of work which our Department of Tourism, our Department of Culture, State Governments and the Government of India can’t do, that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of Indian tourists.
Photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them.
We have to take this task forward.
We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit – we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles.
“If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.”
I have been fortunate that I had a lot of opportunities to travel.
When I was neither Chief Minister nor Prime Minster, and I was young like you, I travelled a lot.
Perhaps there isn’t a district in India which I have not visited.
Travel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives.
These days the youth of India are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity.
In this context, I would like to specially congratulate Coal India.
Western Coalfields Limited at Savaner near Nagpur, where there are coal mines, has developed an Eco-friendly Mine-Tourism Circuit.
We even have a saying, “Coal blackens your hands”, hence people tend to stay away from coal mines.
But Western Coalfields Limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism.
This is only the beginning, but already nearly 10,000 people have visited this Eco-friendly Mine-tourism site at Savaner near Nagpur.
This in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new.
I hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too.
Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done.
Can you too, being a tourist, lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations?
I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task.
We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side.
Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India.
Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens – we all have to come together to make this happen.
Come, let’s make an endeavour in this direction.
My dear young friends, I don’t like it when holidays are just frittered away.
You too should think along these lines.
Will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that?
I will give you something to ponder upon.
Can you resolve to add one skill, one special attribute to your personality, during your holidays?
If you don’t know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays?
If you don’t know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays?
Or you could tell yourself, “I type with just two fingers on the keyboard, so shouldn’t I learn proper way of typing?”
By the time evening falls, you will marvel at what you have created from that rubbish.
You must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent, acquiring some new skill.
There can be countless areas where you could do so; it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that I am spelling out for you.
This will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously.
They will admire you, “You are a very determined man, my friend, you have accomplished something concrete.”
This will perhaps become a big thing among friends.
Sound Byte- “My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds.
I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.
Shilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue.
She says milkmen, newspaper vendors, postmen come close to our homes.
Sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes.
Have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days?
Of course, it is a part of our nature in India.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have repeatedly heard the term – Digital India.
Some people feel that Digital India is to do with the world of the youth in our cities.
If you download this ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips.
If you pose a question to them, they will reply to it; they will explain things to you.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the ‘Kisan Suvidha App’ on their mobile phones.
Why don’t you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you?
If you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, summer is holiday time for the rest of the people, but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more.
A farmer waits for the rains.
Before that, he puts in his life and soul to get his field ready so that not even a single drop of rain water goes waste.
For farmers, the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance.
We will have to give a thought to what will happen if there’s no water.
Can we utilise this time to visit ponds, check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing, because of which reservoirs get depleted.
There must be many such villages in the country, many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work.
But we still need to do much more in this direction.
There I saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture.
But we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields.
Now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed.
I welcome this.
Excessive use of fertilisers has made our Mother Earth unwell.
When we add spices and condiments while cooking our food, it adds to the taste.
But if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments, then would one want to eat that food?
The same food would taste so bad, isn’t it?
The same thing happens with fertilisers as well.
No matter how good fertilisers may be, if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination.
There should be a balance in everything.
This will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money.
Do remember, the more we save water, the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved.
My dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April.
Once it enters yours body, a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it.
It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics.
Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths.
Diabetes is of two types — Type 1 and Type 2.
Type 1 is hereditary; if the parents have it, so shall their child.
Type 2 is due to your habits, age and obesity.
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes.
Physical labour is getting reduced.
Can we not, drawing inspiration from this year’s World Health Day and its theme, do something to defeat Diabetes in our personal life?
If you are interested in Yoga, then do Yoga.
Or else, the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run.
If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my country will be healthy.
Sometimes we are reluctant to get our medical check-up done.
When the condition worsens then only does it come to our notice that it is Diabetes to blame.
What do you lose in getting a check-up done?
Please get this much done at least.
Everything is available and a check-up can be done easily.
Please do be concerned about this.
On March 24th, the world observed Tuberculosis Day.
When I was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word TB.
Compared to the world, we still have a large number of TB patients.
My dear fellow citizens, there is a lot of work being done in this direction.
All one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely.
I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these.
We have to eradicate these diseases from India.
But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you don’t do something about it.
So I call upon all of you today to defeat Diabetes and free ourselves from Tuberculosis.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens.
We can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens.
All you have to do is to give a missed call.
I am happy to state that although it has been barely a month since this service was launched, 35 lakh people have availed of it.
I will be happy to remain connected with you.
My dear fellow citizens, my heartiest best wishes to you all.
Many, many thanks.

Following is the text of the Prime Minister’s letter:-
“You are aware that ever since our Government came into office, I have been working to strengthen our federal polity and promote cooperative federalism.
The people of the country have high expectations from their governments and do not want to wait.
Therefore, since the very beginning, we have been committed to a rapid and inclusive process of growth.
Looking to the diversity of the country, we understand that real and functional Federal Governance is the only vehicle to achieve this objective quickly and holistically.
I sincerely believe that strong states are the foundation of a strong India.
Even as Chief Minister, I had been saying that the progress of the country depends on the progress of states.
This Government is, therefore, committed to the idea of empowering states in all possible ways.
We also believe that states should be allowed to chalk out their programmes and schemes with greater financial strength and autonomy, while observing financial prudence and discipline.
We are clear that without this, local development needs cannot be met and marginalised communities and backward regions cannot be brought into the mainstream.
Such a vision and the concrete steps that all of us take will help in realising the development aspirations of our people.
The 14th FC has recommended a record increase of 10% in the devolution of the divisible pool of resources to states.
This compares with the marginal increases made by previous Finance Commissions.
The total devolution to states in 2015-16 will be significantly higher than in 2014-15.
This naturally leaves far less money with the Central Government.
However, we have taken the recommendations of the 14th FC in a positive spirit as they strengthen your hand in designing and implementing schemes as per your priorities and needs.
In making its recommendations, the 14th FC has made a fundamental shift in the pattern of financing revenue expenditures.
It has assumed all central assistance to State Plan Revenue expenditure to be part of the states’s revenue burden and determined devolution on this basis.
Para 7.43 of its report explains this.
The dominant view of states too has been that a majority of the resources should flow as tax devolution and the number of CSS should be reduced as the 14th FC states in Paras 8.6 & 8.7.
Therefore, there is a shift from scheme and grant based support from the Central Government to a devolution based support.
Hence, the devolution of 42% of divisible resources.
Therefore, as per the 14th FC, all State Plan Revenue expenditure has to be met from the resources being devolved to states.
In spite of this large devolution, we have decided to continue with some support to topmost areas of national priority such as poverty elimination, MNREGA, education, health, rural development, agriculture and a few other areas.
You will appreciate that, following the acceptance of the 14th FC recommendations, we are moving away from rigid centralised planning, forcing a ‘One size fits all’ approach on states.
States have always been voicing their opposition to this philosophy for years.
We are happy with our decision and that resources are going to the right place.
Resources are going to states to ensure that poverty is eliminated, jobs are created; houses, drinking water, roads, schools, hospitals and electricity are provided.
This has never happened in this country before.
In addition, we have recently revised the rates of royalty on minerals which benefits many states.
This is a golden opportunity in our Nation’s economic development process.
My recent visits across the world have shown that there is a lot of optimism about India and interest in investing here.
Everyone wants to partner with India in its growth story.
I expect that every state will come up with a plan for its key priorities and deploy resources for this purpose.
We should also adopt a rigorous system of evaluation of schemes and projects.
I will work with you in this effort.
Together, we have to establish benchmarks in terms of quality of works and their speedy execution.
Let us work together in this direction.
I will be available for any consultation in this regard at any time.”

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Economic Times Global Business Summit.
He said from the days of 2013-14, when India was beset with problems such as runaway inflation, high fiscal deficit and policy paralysis, change is clearly visible today.
Hesitations have been replaced by hope, and obstacles have been replaced by optimism, he said.
The Prime Minister said that since 2014,India has made significant improvements in almost all international rankings and indices.
The Prime Minister drew a contrast between different forms of competition between now and prior to 2014.
The Prime Minister strongly criticized what he described as a “narrative” that certain things are just impossible in India.
In the last four years, the amount of Foreign Direct Investment received in the country was almost equal to what was received in seven years before 2014, the Prime Minister said.
He added that to achieve this, India needed reforms to transform.
Through the Bankruptcy Code, GST, Real Estate Act to name a few, a solid foundation for decades of higher growth has been laid, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that India is a country of 130 crore aspirations and there can never be a singular vision for development and progress.
“Our vision of new India caters to all sections of the society, irrespective of their economic profile, their caste, creed, language and religion,” he added.
Shri Narendra Modi said “our vision of New India includes addressing the challenges of the future while also solving problems of the past.”
In this context, he gave the following examples:
While India is buildingIITs & AIIMS at a rapid pace, it has also built toilets in all schools across the country.
Speaking of positive interventions in the social sector, the Prime Minister said that the Government is reaching out to twelve crore small and marginal farmers by providing them a comfort of rupees six thousand every year.
This will transfer 7.5 lakh crore rupees or about one hundred billion dollars to our farmers over the next ten years, he added.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has wished Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his birthday.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has strongly condemned the terror attack in Pathankot and has said that enemies of humanity who cannot see the nation succeed, had attempted to cause harm to the Indian Armed Forces.
He saluted the Armed Forces for successfully defeating the designs of the terrorists, and paid homage to the jawans who were martyred during the operation.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi would be visiting Vietnam from 2nd September 2016 to 3rd September 2016.
Vietnam is a friendly nation with whom we cherish our relationship.
During the visit, I will hold extensive discussions with Prime Minister Mr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc.
We will review complete spectrum of our bilateral relationship.
I will also meet the President of Vietnam, Mr. Tran Dai Quang, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Mr. Nguyen Phu Trong; and the Chairperson of the National Assembly of Vietnam, Ms. Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan.
We wish to forge a strong economic relationship with Vietnam that can mutually benefit our citizens.
Strengthening the people-to-people ties will also be an my endeavour during the Vietnam visit.
In Vietnam, I will have the opportunity to pay homage to Ho Chi Minh, one of 20th century’s tallest leaders.
I will lay a wreath at the Monument of National Heroes and Martyrs as well as visit the Quan Su Pagoda.
I will visit Hangzhou, China from 3-5 September 2016 for the Annual G-20 Leaders Summit.
I will arrive in Hangzhou from Vietnam where I would have concluded an important bilateral visit.
During the G-20 Summit, I will have an opportunity to engage with other world leaders on pressing international priorities and challenges.
We will discuss putting the global economy on the track of sustainable steady growth and responding to emerging and entrenched social, security and economic challenges.
India will engage constructively on all the issues before us and work towards finding solutions and taking forward the agenda for a robust, inclusive and sustainable international economic order that uplifts the socio-economic conditions of people across the world, especially those who need it most in developing countries.
President of the New Development Bank
Members of the BRICS Business Council
The partnerships you have forged and the networks you have created are energizing the economic growth stories in each BRICS country.
Excellencies and Friends,
India has moved up in the World Bank Index of Ease of Doing Business.
Similarly, we have moved up 32 spots in last two years in the Global Competitiveness Index.
The Goods and Services Tax that was introduced in July is India’s biggest economic reform measure ever.
In one stroke, a unified market of 1.3 billion people has been created.
Programmes like Digital India, Start Up India and Make in India are changing the economic landscape of the country.
They are assisting India turn into a knowledge based, skill supported and technology driven society.
I am happy to note that the BRICS Business Council also has matching priorities of trade & investment facilitation, promoting skills development, infrastructure development, SME Development, e-commerce and digital economy.
Many productive recommendations have come out of your deliberations.
Your work towards establishment of a BRICS Rating Agency, energy cooperation, green finance, and digital economy is particularly noteworthy.
Let me conclude by saying that as Governments, we will offer full support to your endeavours.
Greetings to everyone.
I am privileged to be present among you at the beginning of the 7 day session of Sri Ramakrishna Vachanamrita Satram.
What could be a better example of Ek Bharat…Shreshtha Bharat?
This practice that you have started builds on a long tradition of making the teachings of the scriptures, the words of great gurus available to the common people.
This tradition evolved from the Shrutis to the Smritis.
Shrutis are believed to be revealed divine knowledge, transmitted orally.
Smriti is a class of texts that are based on memory and interpretation.
The message of the saints was carried further by folk singers, the Katha-vachak, the dastangois.
Kabir’s dohas, Meera’s bhajans were carried by singers from village to village.
India is a land that is blessed with a rich cultural and intellectual milieu.
Our land is home to writers, scholars, saints and seers who have expressed themselves freely and fearlessly.
And whenever the history of human civilization has entered the era of knowledge, India has shown the way.
A false perception was created about India that India needed social, political and economic reform initiated by outsiders.
And this change originated from within, driven by our saints and seers who made it their mission to transform society and undertake mass movements to eradicate evils that may have entered into our society.
Nobody was left outside the ambit.
This is why our civilization stands tall, overcoming obstacles.
Those civilizations that did not change with time vanished.
We, on the other hand even altered practices over centuries.
We have always been open to new ideas.
Long before any faith, any culture, India had women saints who took up the issue of gender equality.
They wrote fearlessly and expressed themselves through their powerful writings.
In Hindu philosophy, time is accepted as a very important factor of the absolute – we are Dik-Kaal-Baadhit – conditioned by space and time.
The scriptures say:
Those who inspire you, those who inform you, those who tell you the truth, those who teach you, show you the right way and awaken you, they are all your gurus.
We all remember the role of Shri Narayana Guru in transforming Kerala.
A saint and social reformer from a backward caste who transcended the barriers of caste and promoted social justice.
When the Sivagiri pilgrimage was started, he declared its goals to be the promotion of education, cleanliness, devotion to God, organization, agriculture, trade, handicrafts, and technical training.
Could there be a better example of a teacher setting standards for the advancement of society?
Speaking of Sri Ramakrishna in this gathering may seem like carrying coals to Newcastle, but I cannot stop myself from mentioning those attributes that make him so relevant to present times.
But he renewed the tradition and made it stronger.
He was the saint of social harmony.
“The same Being whom gyaanis call Brahma – the Absolute, is called Atma – Universal Soul, by yogis, and Bhagavan – Personal God with divine attributes, by devotees.
In Kerala you call it ‘Vellam.’
Mahatma Gandhi said: Ramakrishna’s life enables us to see God face to face.
No one can read the story of his life without being convinced that God alone is real and that all else is an illusion.
Sri Ramakrishna is a link between the ancient and the modern.
He showed how the ancient ideals and experiences could be realized even while following the modern way of life.
Simple anecdotes, simple messages – told simply.
But due to their very simplicity, these were embedded in the minds of the listeners.
If we had not a teacher like this, would there have been a disciple like Swami Vivekananda?
The great karmayogi took forward the thought of his guru –
Jatra Jeev, Tatra Shiv – wherever there is a living being, there is Shiva;
Jeeve Daya Noy, Shiv Gyaane Jeev Seba – जीवे दया नोय, शिव ज्ञाने जीव सेबा” – not kindness to living beings, but serving the living being as Shiva Himself –
to his lifelong dedication to serving the Daridra Narayan.
Swami Vivekananda said – Where should you go to seek God?
Are not all the poor, the miserable, the weak, god?
Why not worship them first?
Let these people be your God.
Ramakrishna Mission’s record of service is evidence of this commitment.
All that is important is that he or she can be helped through selfless service.
On the website of the Mission,
For one’s own salvation and for the welfare of the world.
Addressing the gathering at the iconic Capitol Complex, the Prime Minister said that today, people in all parts of the country have connected with Yoga.
He said that the world has come forward to support the idea of International Day of Yoga.
He added that all sections of society too, have come together in this endeavour.
He said that to honour those who are working to popularize Yoga, two awards will be instituted, one at the national level, and the other at the international level.
He was a widely admired musical maestro.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, dedicated the Bansagar Canal Project to the Nation in Mirzapur today.
This project will provide a big boost to irrigation in the region, and will be greatly beneficial for the farmers of Mirzapur and Allahabad districts of Uttar Pradesh.
Shri Narendra Modi laid the Foundation Stone of the Mirzapur Medical College.
He inaugurated 100 Jan AushadhiKendras in the State.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that the area of Mirzapur holds immense potential.
He recalled his last visit to Mirzapur, with French President Macron, for the inauguration of the solar plant.
The Prime Minister mentioned the various development projects and works that he has either inaugurated, or laid the Foundation Stone for, over the last two days.
He said that after 2014, this project was made a part of the Pradhan MantriKrishiSinchaiYojana, and all efforts were made to complete it.
Talking about measures taken for the welfare of farmers by the Union Government, the Prime Minister also mentioned the recent increase in MSP for Kharif crops.
He spoke of the measures taken to provide affordable healthcare to the poor, including Jan AushadhiKendras.
He said the Swachh Bharat Mission is also proving effective in controlling disease.
He said the health assurance scheme – Ayushman Bharat would be rolled out soon.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today laid the Foundation Stone of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute at Gogamukh in Assam.
Addressing a large public meeting on the occasion, the Prime Minister congratulated the State Government in Assam and Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, for the work done by them in the State.
He said the foundation stone of IARI laid today, had the potential to impact the entire region in a positive way in the future.
He said agriculture needs to be developed in line with the requirements of the 21st century.
He added that farmers must benefit from the changing technology.
He stressed on the need of modern agriculture and technological interventions, keeping in mind the specific needs of the region.
The Prime Minister spoke of his vision of doubling farmers’ incomes by 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence.
The Prime Minister said the Union Government had taken a number of steps for farmers’ welfare in the last three years.
In this context he mentioned the soil health cards, the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, and the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.
He spoke of the vast network of soil health laboratories being set up across the country, and the popularity of the Fasal Bima Yojana among farmers.
The Prime Minister spoke of “Panch Tatva” – five elements to boost connectivity in the North-East: Railways, Highways, Airways, Waterways, and i-ways.
“Greetings on Ambedkar Jayanti.
PujyaBabasaheb gave hope to lakhs of people belonging to the poorest and marginalised sections of society.
Mr. Li Yuanchao, Vice President of the People’s Republic of China met Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.
The Prime Minister warmly recalled the visit of President Xi Jinping to India last year, and his own visit to China in May this year.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for adjudication of dispute on Mahanadi River Waters.
The Tribunal shall determine water sharing among basin States on the basis of the overall availability of water in the complete Mahanadi basin, contribution of each State, the present utilization of water resources in each State and the potential for future development.
As per provisions of the Inter-State River Water Disputes (ISRWD) Act, 1956, the Tribunal shall consist of a Chairman and two other Members nominated by the Chief Justice of India from amongst the Judges of the Supreme Court or High Court.
Further, services of two Assessors who are water resources experts having experience in handling sensitive water-related issues will be provided to advise the Tribunal in its proceedings.
I am delighted to have the opportunity to welcome President Tusk and President Juncker for the 14th India-EU Summit.
I am heartily thankful to President Tusk and President Juncker for the productive discussions that we have had today on our wide-ranging agenda.
We have expanded the India-EU engagement into many new sectors and have agreed that we must continue our efforts to make it more comprehensive and beneficial, based on mutual trust and understanding.
Today, we have reviewed the progress in implementation of the decisions taken at our last Summit, and the Agenda 2020 announced last year.
The signing of loan agreements for development projects in India with the European Investment Bank is also a welcome step.
I also appreciate the decision of the European Investment Bank to fund solar-related projects in member countries of the International Solar Alliance.
We are also committed to working with the EU to further deepen our cooperation in strengthening our trade and investment flows.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
We human beings have a natural inclination to be enchanted by the delights of the rainy season.
Animals, birds, flora – nature in its entirety, is filled with the joys of the season.
But sometimes, when the rain unleashes full force of its fury, we come to realise the extent of the destructive might of water.
Mother Nature gives us life and nurtures us, but at times natural catastrophes such as floods and earthquakes wreak havoc on a massive scale.
Climate change, altered weather cycles, and transformations in the environment, are also having a big negative impact.
Recently, in certain parts of India, particularly, Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some areas of Bengal, have had to bear the brunt of natural disasters, caused by excessive rains.
Flood affected areas are being closely monitored.
Relief efforts have been undertaken on an extensive cale.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are also personally visiting affected areas.
The state governments too are making maximum possible efforts on their part to provide relief to the flood affected people.
Social organisations, cultural organizations and common citizens charged with the spirit of service are also making their utmost efforts to help the affected people in this situation.
The Government of India, Army personnel, Air Force personnel, NDRF personnel, Paramilitary forces – everybody does his or her best in providing succour to the disaster stricken people.
Life goes completely topsy-turvy as a result of the floods.
Crops, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electricity, communication links – everything gets affected.
NDRF teams were deployed.
Aapada Mitra, or Friends during Disaster were identified at various places and these were then trained in the Do’s and Don’ts; volunteers were enlisted, and a people’s organisation set up to work in this situation.
Weather forecasts are available these days and the concerned technology has become so advanced these days, and space science also plays a very big role, that these weather forecasts turn out to be mostly accurate now.
We should also gradually make it our nature to set our work patterns according to the weather predictions, which could safeguard us against losses.
Whenever I prepare myself for ‘Mann Ki Baat’, I find that the citizens of our country prepare themselves even more.
I would like you to hear one such phone call: –
“Namaskar, Pradhan Mantri ji, this is Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard your speech on the Chartered Accountants Day and was deeply impressed.
In the same manner, Goods and Services Tax, GST, was launched on this very day last month.
Could you please elaborate whether its results after one month are matching the expectations of the Government?
I would like to hear your views on this.
It has been one month since GST was implemented and its benefits can be seen already.
I feel very happy and satisfied when a poor person writes to say how because of GST prices of various items essential for him have come down, and commodities have become cheaper.
And most important of all, the trust of customers for the traders is increasing.
I have been observing how GST has impacted the transport and logistics sector; how the movement of trucks has increased.
The time required to cover distances has come down drastically.
Highways have become clutter-free.
Pollution levels have come down with the increased speeds of the trucks.
Goods are also being transported much faster.
The speed at which the smooth transition has taken place, along with rapid migration and new registrations, has instilled a new sense of confidence in the entire country.
And some day, the Pundits of Economics, Pundits of Management and Pundits of Technology, will certainly undertake researches and write about India’s GST experiment as a model for the world.
It will become a case study for universities across the world.
The implementation and furtherance of such a phenomenal change on such a monumental scale, with the involvement of so many tens of millions of people in such a vast country, is in itself a pinnacle of success.
The world will definitely make a study of it.
And this implementation has had all the states participating in it and sharing the responsibility.
All decisions have been taken unanimously by the states and the Centre together.
And as a result, one overriding priority for every government has been to ensure that there is no burden on the plate of the poor on account of GST.
And using the GST App all information is available on your mobile phone as to how much the price of an item was earlier and how much will it be now in the new situation.
The lofty dream of One Nation – One Tax has finally been fulfilled.
I extend my heartiest felicitations to each and every ministry, every department and all employees of the Central and State governments involved with this process.
GST is a fine example of the collective strength of the people of India.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform; it is a new economic order that will strengthen a new culture of honesty.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reformation.
I would like to once again express my deep gratitude to the millions of my countrymen who have contributed to the successful achievement of this great feat with such felicity.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of Revolution.
We have been hearing this as a natural fact right from our childhood and the reason is, the Non-Cooperation Movement was launched on the 1st of August 1920; the Quit India Movement, which is also known as ‘Agast Kranti’ began on the 9th of August 1942; and on 15thAugust 1947 India became independent.
Our young generation must know what had happened on the 9th of August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of India, with their ardent desire for freedom, came together, fought together, and suffered hardships; these pages of history are an inspiration to us for building a glorious India.
This was the time when the people of India, in every part of the country – be it a village or city, the educated or illiterate, the rich or poor, everyone came together shoulder to shoulder and became a part of the ‘Quit India Movement.’
People’s anger was at its peak.
Millions of Indians responded to Mahatma Gandhi’s clarion call and the mantra of ‘Do or Die’; they flung themselves into the struggle.
In the ‘Non-Cooperation Movement’ of 1920 and the ‘Quit India Movement’ of 1942, two different personas of Mahatma Gandhi can be seen.
The whole scenario of the ‘Quit India Movement’ was different and in 1942 things rose to such a point, there was such a heightened sense of intensity, that a Mahapurush like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of “Do or Die.”
The reason for this entire success was the people’s support, people’s resolve, and people’s struggle.
The entire country had come together as one to fight for the cause.
And I sometimes think that if we link the pages of history, it is seen that the First War of Independence took place in 1857.
Each one became committed to do something.
The determination did not diminish with each passing generation.
New people kept coming forward each time in place of those who departed and the country kept on every moment endeavouring tirelessly to uproot the British Rule.
This perseverance, this struggle from 1857 to 1942 created a situation which reached its climax in 1942; the clarion call of ‘Quit India’ was such that within five years, in 1947 the British were compelled to leave India.
I would now like to connect you with its mathematical manifestation.
It has been almost 70 years.
Governments have come and gone.
Systems have been made, changed, nurtured, and expanded.
Everyone has tried to rid the country of its problems in one’s own way.
There have been efforts towards increasing employment, poverty alleviation, and development.
We should celebrate 15th August 2017 as the Sankalp Parva or the Day of Resolve, and in 2022 marking 75 years of Freedom, we will certainly transform that resolve into ‘Siddhi’ or attainment.
Just as the five years from 1942 to 1947 were decisive for the country’s Independence, these five years from 2017 to 2022 can and must play a decisive role for the future of India.
Five years from now, we will celebrate 75 years of India’s Independence.
In this month of August, we have to come together and resolve: Filth – Quit India; Poverty – Quit India; Corruption – Quit India; Terrorism – Quit India; Casteism – Quit India; Communalism – Quit India!
The need for today is not ‘Do or Die’, instead it is to resolve, to come together, persevere, and work relentlessly with our utmost strength towards the making of a new India.
Let us live by and strive for this resolve.
I would particularly like to call upon the online world, since wherever we may be, we are almost always online; so I would like to invite the online community and specially my young friends to come forward and contribute innovatively for building of the New India.
They can use technology – videos, posts, blogs, scripts, novel ideas – to put forward all these.
Transform this campaign into a peoples’ movement.
A Quit India Quiz is also being launched for my young friends on NarendraModiApp.
This quiz is an attempt to familiarise the youth with India’s glorious history and the heroes of the freedom movement.
It is my belief that you will surely publicise and spread awareness about this quiz.
And the ‘I’ gets an opportunity to transform into a ‘We’.
As far as the economy is concerned, hundreds of families start making Rakhis in small household units, many months before the festival of Rakhi.
Today as I speak about festivals and how they are linked to the economy of the poor, I want to touch upon the subject of environment as well.
I have observed and sometimes think that the citizens of our country are more aware and active than me.
For the last one month, environmentally conscious citizens have constantly written letters to me.
And they have requested that I talk about eco-friendly Ganesha idols, well in time for people to plan for clay Ganesha idols during the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.
125 years and 1.25 billion countrymen!
How we must lend strength to that spirit and at the same time resolve to use eco-friendly clay Ganesha idols, to protect the environment.
I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen for the various upcoming festivals and celebrations.
My dear countrymen, we are continually seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels to the country in all the fields – be it education, economic activities, social spheres or in sports – they are scaling new heights.
We as a nation take great pride in our daughters.
Recently our daughters performed brilliantly in the Women’s Cricket World Cup.
This week I had the opportunity to meet our daughters, the members of our Women’s Cricket team.
This stress, this tension was evident on their faces also.
So while speaking to these daughters, I put forth a different viewpoint before them.
We have seen during many such events where if the Indian players fail, the anger of the country is vented towards the players.
Some people cross all limits of decency and say and write things that inflict pain and hurt.
I view this as a healthy and pleasant change and I told these daughters that only they were blessed with such good fortune, and hence they should banish any thought of not having been successful.
You may not have won the final match but you have won the hearts of 1.25 billion Indians.
Truly our young generation, especially the daughters of our country are doing so much to bring glory to the nation.
And I am reminding you once again of 2022, 75 years of India’s Independence.
Every countryman should make a resolve, every countryman should prepare a 5-year roadmap to realise that resolve.
The destiny, the future of the country shall be brighter, let us move ahead with this belief.
Distinguished Guests from India and abroad
A very good morning to all of you.
I am happy to be here once again with you at the Global Business Summit.
Let me first compliment you for choosing the word Social as the first word of your theme for a business summit;
I am also happy to note that the people present here are discussing thechallenge of how to make development sustainable, which happens to be the second word of your theme.
And when you talk about Scalability which is the third word of the theme for this summit, it gives me hope and confidence that you are indeed discussing solutions for India.
Who would know better than all of you present here about the challenges the country was facing during the second half of 2013 and early 2014;
Run-away inflation was breaking the back of every house-hold.
Increasing current account deficit and higher fiscal deficit were threateningthe macro-economic stability of the country.
All these parameters were indicating a gloomy future;
The country was facing total policy paralysis.
This was preventing the economy from reaching the level which it was worthy of;
The global fraternity was worried about the health of this member of fragile five club.
There was a perception of surrender to existing circumstances
It was in this background that our government came to serve the people and today change is clearly visible.
After 2014,hesitations have been replaced by hope.
Obstacles have been replaced by optimism.
Issues have been replaced by initiatives.
Since 2014,India has made significant improvements in almost all international rankings and indices.
This not only shows how India is changing but also represents how the world’s perception about India is changing.
I am aware that there are some who cannot appreciate this rapid improvement.
They suggest that rankings only improve things on paper, but nothing changes on the ground.
I think this is far from the truth.
Rankings are mostly lagging indicators.
Things change on ground first, but reflect in rankings after a time lag.
Take the example of Ease of Doing Business rankings.
Our rankings have improved from 142 to a historic high of 77 in four years.
But the change in rankings has been preceded by improvement in situation on the ground.
Even for the small traders, compliance is getting easier.
Now a business with a turn-over of upto Rupees forty lakh does not have to register for GST.
Now a business with a turn-over of upto Rupees sixty lakh does not have to pay any income tax.
Now a business with a turnover of upto Rupees 1.5 crore is eligible for the composition scheme with very nominal tax rate.
In the same way, India’s ranking in the World Travel and TourismCompetitiveness index has gone up from sixty five in 2013 to forty in 2017.
Similarly, India’s rank in Global Innovation Index has gone up from seventy six in 2014 to fifty seven in 2018.
This surge in innovation is clearly visible.
This improvement in culture is also visible.
The number of patents and trade-marks filed also show a great increase.
The change is due to a new style of governance and is often visible in interesting ways.
I would like to give you such an interesting example of how things have changed since 2014.
We are now witnessing various forms of competition.
A competition between ministries,
a competition between states,
a competition on development,
a competition on achieving targets.
Today, there is a competition as to whether India will get 100% sanitation first or 100% electrification first.
There is competition as to whether all habitations will be connected by road first or all homes will get gas connection first.
There is competition as to which state will attract more investment.
There is competition as to which states will build houses for the poor fastest.
There was competition on who can do maximum corruption,
there was competition on who can do fastest corruption,
there was competition on who can do most innovation in corruption.
There was competition as to whether coal will get more money or spectrum.
There was competition as to whether CWG would get more money or defence deals.
We all saw that and we also know who were the main players involved in this competition.
I will leave it to you to decide which form of competition you would prefer.
For decades,a narrative was made that certain things are just impossible in India.
The progress our nation has achieved since 2014 gives me confidence that nothing is impossible for 130 crore Indians.
It was said that making a clean India was impossible, but people of India are making it possible.
Post liberalisation that is after 1991, almost all governments formed in our country had to face this problem – what many experts call “over-heating” of economy after a short period of growth.
As a result of this we never had sustainable higher rate of growth.
During 2014 to 2019, the country would register average growth of seven point four percent and the average inflation would be less than four and half percent;
Post liberalisation of Indian economy, this will be the highest rate of average growth and lowest rate of average inflation witnessed during the period of any government.
With these changes and reforms, transformation is happening in the way our economy has moved.
The Indian economy has expanded the bouquet of its financing resources.
It is no more dependent on banks credit for investment needs.
Take the example of fund raising from the capital market.
During 2011-12 to 2013-14, that is, three years prior to this government,
the average amount of fund raised through equity was about rupees fourteen thousand crore per annum.
In the last four years, this average is about rupees forty three thousand crore per annum.
This is almost three times.
The total amount raised by Alternative Investment Funds during 2011 to 2014 was less than rupees four thousand crore.
Our Government took various measures to develop this source of financing in the economy.
And, you can see the result
– from 2014 to 2018 in four years, the total amount raised by Alternative Investment Funds is more than rupees eighty one thousand crore.
This is a jump of the order of twenty times.
Similarly let us see the example of private placement of corporate bonds.
The average amount of fund raised through this during 2011 to 2014 was about rupees three lakh crore or about forty billion dollars.
Now the average over the last four years has gone up to rupees five point two five lakh crore or about seventy five billion dollars.
This is a jump of almost seventy five percent.
All these are examples of confidence shown in the Indian economy.
Today this confidence is shown not only by domestic investors, but also by investors from all across the world.
In the last four years, the amount of Foreign Direct Investment received in the country was almost equal to what was received in seven years before 2014.
To achieve all this, India needed reforms to transform.
And by having the Bankruptcy Code, GST, Real Estate Act to name a few, – a solid foundation for decades of higher growth has been laid.
All these reforms were implemented without halting work for the well-being of the larger sections of society.
India is a country of 130 crore aspirations and there can never be a singular vision for development and progress.
Our vision of new India caters to all sections of the society, irrespective of their economic profile, their caste, creed, language and religion.
We are working hard to create a New India which fulfils the aspirations and dreams of 130 crore Indians.
Our vision of new India includes addressing the challenges of the future while also solving problems of the past.
So today, while India has made its fastest train, it has also eliminated all un-manned railway crossings.
Today, while India is buildingIITs & AIIMS at a rapid pace, it has also built toilets in all schools across the country.
Today, while India is building a 100 smart cities across the country, it is also ensuring rapid progress in over 100 aspirational districts.
Today, while India has become a net exporter of electricity, it has also ensured that crores of households which were in darkness since independence have got electricity.
Today, while India aims to land on Mars, it is also ensuring that every Indian has a roof over his head.
Today, while India is the fastest growing world economy, it is also removing poverty at the fastest speed.
We have moved away from the A,B,C mentality – that is
“A” for avoiding,
“B” for burying and
Instead of avoiding an issue, we dealt with the issue;
Instead of burying it, we dug it out and communicated to the people;
Instead of confusing the system, we demonstrated that a solution is possible.
We are reaching out to twelve crore small and marginal farmers by providing them a comfort of rupees six thousand every year.
This will transfer 7.5 lakh crore rupees or about one hundred billion dollars to our farmers over the next ten years.
We are rolling out a pension scheme for crores of our informal sector workers.
and other providing physical infrastructure for all and particularly for generation next to shape their future as per their dreams.
What happened in the past is not in our hands, but what will happen in the future is firmly in our hands.
The extent and magnitude of our contribution will surprise the world.
I am also confident that India may have missed the bus during the first three industrial revolutions, but this time, it is a bus India has not only boarded but will also drive.
The outcomes of our focus on Digital India, Start-up India, Make In India and Innovate India are converging and reaping rich dividends.
Do you know that while around four thousand patents were granted in 2013 and 2014, more than thirteen thousand patents were granted in 2017-18?
This is a three fold increase!
Similarly, do you know that the number of trade-marks registered has also gone up from around sixty eight thousand in 2013-14 to around two point five lakh in 2016-17.
This is almost a four fold increase!
You would be happy to know that today 44 percent of the startups registered in India are from tier 2 and tier3 cities?
A network of hundreds of Atal Tinkering Labs is coming up across the country and helping foster an atmosphere of innovation.
This will give a solid foundation for our students to help them become innovators of tomorrow.
I was impressed to see how a young girl from the snake charmer community was literally charming the mouse and making the most of digital India.
It is equally heartening to see how youth in villages are leveraging Wi-Fi and digital tools to help in clearing competitive exams.
It is technology which is bridging the gap between the haves and have-nots in our country.
Stories like these are writing a new chapter in the history of India.
With the support and partnership of the people, India has made rapid strides since 2014.
This could not have been possible without Jan Bhagidaari.
It is this experience that gives us confidence that our country can provide adequate opportunities to all its citizens, to grow, prosper and excel.
We look forward to making India a ten trillion dollar economy,
We look forward to making India the third largest economy,
We want to make an India of countless startups,
We want to lead the global drive towards renewable sources of energy,
We want to give our people energy security
We want to cut down on import dependence;
We want to make India a world leader in electric vehicles and energy storage devices.
With these goals in mind, let us re-dedicate ourselves to create a New India of our dreams.
Thank You Very Much.
I have often heard people wonder, as to how the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper.
Can a newspaper, devote just a few column inches of space, each day for one year, to this cause?
Every day, they can write one simple sentence in their language of publication, along with its translation, and trans-literation, in all major Indian languages.
My dear citizens
I hope you ended the festive season of Diwali with joy and new hope.
Today, I will be speaking to you about some critical issues and important decisions.
Today I want to make a special request to all of you.
Since then, we had two years of severe drought.
Yet, in the last two and a half years with the support of 125 crore Indians, India has become the “bright spot” in the global economy.
It is not just we who are saying this; it is being stated by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
In this effort for development, our motto has been ‘Sab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas’: We are with all citizens and for development of all citizens.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana,
the Jan Suraksha Yojana,
the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana for small enterprises,
the Stand-up India programme for Dalits, Adivasis and Women,
the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Scheme for gas connections in the homes of the poor,
the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana to protect the income of farmers,
the Soil Health Card Scheme to ensure the best possible yield from farmers’ fields,
and the e-NAM National Market Place scheme to ensure farmers get the right price for their produce
—these are all reflections of this approach.
In spite of many steps taken, we have only been able to reach a ranking of seventy-six now.
Of course, there is improvement.
This shows the extent to which corruption and black money have spread their tentacles.
The evil of corruption has been spread by certain sections of society for their selfish interest.
They have ignored the poor and cornered benefits.
Some people have misused their office for personal gain.
We hear about poor auto-rickshaw drivers returning gold ornaments left in the vehicles to their rightful owners.
We hear about taxi drivers who take pains to locate the owners of cell phones left behind.
We hear of vegetable vendors who return excess money given by customers.
There comes a time in the history of a country’s development when a need is felt for a strong and decisive step.
For years, this country has felt that corruption, black money and terrorism are festering sores, holding us back in the race towards development.
This has been going on for years.
Many times, those using fake five hundred and thousand rupee notes have been caught and many such notes have been seized.
On the one hand is the problem of terrorism; on the other is the challenge posed by corruption and black money.
We began our battle against corruption by setting up an SIT headed by a retired Supreme Court judge, immediately upon taking office.
• a law was passed in 2015 for disclosure of foreign black money;
• agreements with many countries, including the USA, have been made to add provisions for sharing banking information;
• a strict law has come into force from August 2016 to curb benami transactions, which are used to deploy black money earned through corruption;
• a scheme was introduced for declaring black money after paying a stiff penalty;
My dear countrymen,
Through all these efforts, in the last two and a half years, we have brought into the open nearly 1 lakh 25 thousand crore rupees of black money belonging to the corrupt.
Honest citizens want this fight against corruption, black money, benami property, terrorism and counterfeiting to continue.
Which honest citizen would not be pained by reports of crores worth of currency notes stashed under the beds of government officers?
Or by reports of cash found in gunny bags?
The magnitude of cash in circulation is directly linked to the level of corruption.
Inflation becomes worse through the deployment of cash earned in corrupt ways.
The poor have to bear the brunt of this.
It has a direct effect on the purchasing power of the poor and the middle class.
You may yourself have experienced when buying land or a house, that apart from the amount paid by cheque, a large amount is demanded in cash.
This creates problems for an honest person in buying property.
The misuse of cash has led to artificial increase in the cost of goods and services like houses, land, higher education, health care and so on.
Debate on the role of black money in elections has been going on for years.
To break the grip of corruption and black money, we have decided that the five hundred rupee and thousand rupee currency notes presently in use will no longer be legal tender from midnight tonight, that is 8th November 2016.
This means that these notes will not be acceptable for transactions from midnight onwards.
The five hundred and thousand rupee notes hoarded by anti-national and anti-social elements will become just worthless pieces of paper.
The rights and the interests of honest, hard-working people will be fully protected.
Let me assure you that notes of one hundred, fifty, twenty, ten, five, two and one rupee and all coins will remain legal tender and will not be affected.
This step will strengthen the hands of the common man in the fight against corruption, black money and fake currency.
To minimise the difficulties of citizens in the coming days, several steps are being taken.
1. Persons holding old notes of five hundred or one thousand rupees can deposit these notes in their bank or post office accounts from 10th November till close of banking hours on 30th December 2016 without any limit.
You need have no worry on this point.
4. After depositing your money in your account, you can draw it when you need it.
5. Keeping in mind the supply of new notes, in the first few days, there will be a limit of ten thousand rupees per day and twenty thousand rupees per week.
This limit will be increased in the coming days.
6. Apart from depositing your notes in your bank account, another facility will also be there.
7. For your immediate needs, you can go to any bank, head post office or sub post office, show your identity proof like Aadhaar card, voter card, ration card, passport, PAN card or other approved proofs, and exchange your old five hundred or thousand rupee notes for new notes.
8. From 10th November till 24th November the limit for such exchange will be four thousand rupees.
From 25th November till 30th December, the limit will be increased.
9. There may be some who, for some reason, are not able to deposit their old five hundred or thousand rupee notes by 30th December 2016.
11. On 9th November and in some places on 10th November also, ATMs will not work.
In the first few days, there will be a limit of two thousand rupees per day per card.
12. This will be raised to four thousand rupees later.
13. Five hundred and thousand rupee notes will not be legal tender from midnight.
However for humanitarian reasons, to reduce hardship to citizens, some special arrangements have been made for the first 72 hours, that is till midnight on 11th November.
14. During this period, government hospitals will continue to accept five hundred and thousand rupee notes for payment.
15. This is for the benefit of those families whose members may be unwell.
16. Pharmacies in government hospitals will also accept these notes for buying medicines with doctors’ prescription.
17. For 72 hours, till midnight on 11th November, railway ticket booking counters, ticket counters of government buses and airline ticket counters at airports will accept the old notes for purchase of tickets.
This is for the benefit of those who may be travelling at this time.
18. For 72 hours, five hundred and thousand rupee notes will be accepted also at
• Petrol, diesel and CNG gas stations authorised by public sector oil companies
• Consumer co-operative stores authorised by State or Central Government
• Milk booths authorised by State governments
These outlets will have to keep proper records of stock and collections.
19. Arrangements will be made at international airports for arriving and departing passengers who have five hundred or thousand rupee notes of not more than five thousand rupees, to exchange them for new notes or other legal tender.
20. Foreign tourists will be able to exchange foreign currency or old notes of not more than Rs 5000 into legal tender.
In spite of all these efforts there may be temporary hardships to be faced by honest citizens.
Experience tells us that ordinary citizens are always ready to make sacrifices and face difficulties for the benefit of the nation.
I have full confidence that every citizen will stand up and participate in this ‘mahayagna’.
Secrecy was essential for this action.
It is only now, as I speak to you, that various agencies like banks, post offices, railways, hospitals and others are being informed.
The Reserve Bank, banks and post offices have to make many arrangements at very short notice.
Obviously, time will be needed.
Therefore all banks will be closed to the public on 9th November.
However, I appeal to all of you to help the banks and post offices to meet this challenge with poise and determination.
My dear citizens,
From time to time, based on currency needs, the Reserve Bank with the approval of the Central Government brings out new notes of higher value.
In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a recommendation for issue of five thousand and ten thousand rupee notes.
New notes of five hundred rupees and two thousand rupees, with completely new design will be introduced.
The more help you give in this campaign, the more successful it will be.
It has been a matter of concern for all of us that corruption and black money tend to be accepted as part of life.
This type of thinking has afflicted our politics, our administration and our society like an infestation of termites.
None of our public institutions is free from these termites.
Time and again, I have seen that when the average citizen has to choose between accepting dishonesty and bearing inconvenience, they always choose to put up with inconvenience.
They will not support dishonesty.
Once again, let me invite you to make your contribution to this grand sacrifice for cleansing our country, just as you cleaned up your surroundings during Diwali.
Let us ignore the temporary hardship
Let us join this festival of integrity and credibility
Let us enable coming generations to live their lives with dignity
Let us fight corruption and black money
Let us ensure that the nation’s wealth benefits the poor
Let us enable law-abiding citizens to get their due share.
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.

It is truly a great honour and privilege to host you in India for the second Summit of Forum for India Pacific Islands Cooperation – FIPIC, as it is called now.
I am deeply grateful to you for coming to India.
I am aware that the journey is not short and you have busy schedules.

If you are visiting India for the first time, I am sure you are struck by the size, the culture, the diversity and the sea of people, like we are wonderstruck at the thought of a Nation living as a small community in harmony with Nature on a beautiful island!
It is this diversity that makes our planet so special!
It is also special because India and Pacific Island Countries are setting an example of partnerships for this century.
It is a partnership forged by shared aspirations and challenges.
It is shaped by the belief that all Nations, small and large, have equal stakes in this world.
We also recognise that a globalised world has deepened inter-dependence and changed our perception of geography.
For this reason, the tides that bear hopes and bring challenges to the shores in India and the Pacific Islands are the same.
That is why some call the region the Indo-Pacific Region.
But that is not all that brings us together.

We seek your support for the text of the President of the General Assembly as a basis for reforming the Security Council.
Your voice of support for India’s permanent membership of the Security Council will give the United Nations the global character and balance that mirrors our age.
just as FIPIC should become our springboard for a stronger global partnership, we can also enrich each other through our bilateral and regional cooperation.

The world is increasingly witnessing division and hostility on religious lines.
This has become a matter of global concern.
In this context the ancient Indian plea of mutual respect for all faiths is now beginning to manifest in global discourse.
In their historic declaration, they defined what constitutes freedom of faith and how it is to be safeguarded.
We consider the freedom to have, to retain, and to adopt, a religion or belief, is a personal choice of a citizen.
My government will ensure that there is complete freedom of faith and that everyone has the undeniable right to retain or adopt the religion of his or her choice without coercion or undue influence.
My government will not allow any religious group, belonging to the majority or the minority, to incite hatred against others, overtly or covertly.
Mine will be a government that gives equal respect to all religions.
I have embarked on a huge mission to convert that vision into reality.
In simple terms it means food on every table, every child in school, a job for everybody and a house with toilet and electricity for every family.
This will make India proud.
We can achieve this through unity.
Unity strengthens us.
Division weakens us.
I sincerely request all Indians, and all of you present here to support me in this huge task.

I thank President Xi Jinping for bringing us together for this dialogue.
Two years since the adoption of UN’s 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the imperative of collaborative action to achieve the goals is even stronger.
Recently in July, India completed its first voluntary national review of SDGs.
The bedrock of our development agenda lies in the notion of “SabkaSaath,SabkaVikaas” – that is: Collective Effort, Inclusive Growth.
We have mapped each of the SDGs to our own development programmes and scheme, both at the federal and state level.
Our Parliament too has taken the initiative to organize Parliamentary debates on SDGs.
Our programmes are geared to accomplish these priority goals in a time-bound manner.
We would like to see such domestic efforts buttressed by strong international partnerships.
And, for this, we stand ready to do our part.
The “Solar Mamas” of Africa, trained in India, are lighting up thousands of homes across the African continent.
And, in all of this, our “no strings attached” model of cooperation is driven purely by the requirements and priorities of our partner countries.
Through these agenda points, and action on them, we will be contributing directly to the welfare of the Global Community in addition to welfare of our own people.
I am very fortunate that once again I have got the opportunity to meet you.
His highness crown prince of Abu Dhabhi visited India in 2016.
In 2017, he was the Chief Guest of our extremely important Republic Day function.
Today, our relation with the gulf countries is not just confined to a buyer-seller relationship but it has become a partnership.
India takes pride in that more than 3 million Indians living in the gulf countries have become partners in the developmental journey of this region.
Indian community also sowed the seeds of their dreams along with the dreams of local people and also with the same commitment by considering this place as their own home.
And, in a way, we have been able to experience a very good partnership among the human groups in the gulf countries.
In UAE, people were surprised when his highness crown prince took the initiative of constructing a temple in Abu Dhabi when I came here last time.
It will be a compelling responsibility for all those related with the construction of the temple, for all the future devotees that there should not be anything that might hurt the high ideals and principles of humanity even a bit.
I have this expectation from all of you.
Today, the country is scaling new heights of development.
Here, it’s not difficult for you to gather information about India.
You have such knowledge about India that if I talk about one thing then you will talk about ten things.
And in a way a mini India resides here.
There is not even a single corner in this country where India is not represented.
And that is why you can experience very well how fast India has been changing and with what kind of confidence 1.25 billion Indians have been moving ahead to realise their dreams.
There was a time when the common man of this country used to ask, if it was possible ?
Whether it can be done in our country?
The destiny has entrusted India with some responsibilities for the fulfillment of her global role.
Today, the world says that the 21st century belongs to Asia.
Then it’s not like that it will happen automatically; it’s not like that we will continue to keep our hands like this and it will happen automatically.
We may or may not like them now but these things will be in our long term interests.
There are some people who can immediately understand the step that we take.
For others it is a problem and they take time to understand.
If I replace currency then the poor section of the society immediately understands that it’s a solid step in the right direction.
However, the one who spent sleepless nights continues to weep even after two years.
For the last seven years it was being debated whether GST law should be implemented or not.
It’s been done now.
We later realise that it’s a new house and the bathroom is on the right side in this house.
Whether everybody has experienced this thing or not?
However, it’s worthwhile to do so.
This is the way which was shown by Mahatma Gandhi.
I was in Abu Dhabi yesterday and have signed several agreements.
I am finishing this visit in Jet speed.
I’m going to return after visiting five countries within 70-80 hours.
Jordan, Palestine, Abu Dhabi and now I’m in Dubai and from here I will go to Oman.
I assure you of this thing.
Once again I thank you very much.
I hope this special day strengthens the bonds of unity, peace and brotherhood.

Prof. Maitree Wickremesinghe
Hon’ble Ministers of Sri Lanka,
The High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka,
Hon’ble Chief Minister of the Northern Province,
Hon’ble Members of Parliament of Sri Lanka
Respected Religious leaders,
I am very happy to be talking to you in Jaffna today through Live Video Link.
I am all the more happy that this is the occasion when the National Emergency Ambulance service is being extended all over Sri Lanka.
This event marks another major achievement in the development partnership of India and Sri Lanka.
My Friend Prime Minister Wickeremesinghe had talked to me during my visit to Sri Lanka in 2015 about establishing such a system in Sri Lanka.
I am very happy that in July 2016, the first phase of this service began in the Western and Southern Provinces.
During my visit to Sri Lanka last year I had promised the friendly people of Sri Lanka that India will work for expanding the pre-hospital Emergency Ambulance Service all over Sri Lanka.
I am also happy that this phase of expansion begins with the Northern Province.
India is happy to work together with you for wipingtears from the past and ushering in a bright future.
I understand that the people associated with this service have been trained in India.
The requiredskills and the local employment will also receive a boost.
It is not just a co-incidence that India has the privilegeto be Sri Lanka’s partner in establishing this first responder service and in its expansion.
In good times and bad, India has been, and will always be the first responder for Sri Lanka.
As leaders of two democracies full of diversity, both Prime Minister Wickeremesinghe and I believe in delivering benefits of development to all sections of the society.
I appreciate the efforts of President His Excellency Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickeremesinghe for meeting the aspirations of all the citizens of Sri Lanka.
I have very fond memories from my two visits to Sri Lanka as Prime Minister.
I have been overwhelmed by the love and affection, which were showered on me.
I also had the good fortune of being the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Jaffna.
I could also participate last year in the UN Vesak day celebrations.
All these are unforgettable experiences.
The existence of all nations is closely linked to their neighbours.
When I look at Sri Lanka, I see not only a neighbour, I see a very special and trusted partner of India in South Asia and in the Indian Ocean family.
I believe that our development cooperation with Sri Lanka is an important means for translating our vision of shared progress into reality.
I am reminded of what Mahatma Gandhi had said in 1927, when he had visited Sri Lanka at the invitation of the student Congress of Jaffna.
He had then travelled from Matara in the South to Point Pedro in the North.
I have the same message today.
Our people should be in constant touch with each other.
So that we know each other better and become even closer friends.
I would encourage you to come to India and experience the New India that is taking shape.
I am happy to learn that His Excellency Prime MinisterWickeremesinghewill be visiting India in early August.
I wish you a comfortable journey and enjoyable stay in India..
Thank you very much.

I am happy to be here today on the occasion of the golden jubilee week of Auroville.
Sri Aurobindo’s vision of India’s spiritual leadership continues to inspire us, even today.
It is important today to remember the vast extent of action and thought of Shri Aurobindo.
In the words of RabindraNath Tagore:
Rabindranath, O Aurobindo, bows to thee!
The large gathering here today, is a reflection of that idea.
For ages, India has been a spiritual destination for the world.
The great universities of Nalanda and Taxila hosted students from all over the world.
Many of the world’s great religions were born here.
They motivate people from all walks of life,) to take to a spiritual path in their day to day dealings.
Recently, the United Nations has declared June 21 as International Day of Yoga, recognizing a great Indian tradition.
Auroville has brought together men and women, young and old, cutting across boundaries and identities.
I understand that Auroville’s Charter was hand-written in French by the Divine Mother herself.
According to the Charter, the Mother set five high principles for Auroville.
I am told, that the inauguration ceremony of Auroville in 1968 was attended by delegates of 124 nations.
I learn that today, it has over two thousand, four hundred residents from forty-nine countries.
The third founding principle of Auroville is that it will emerge as the bridge between the past and the future.
If one looks at where the world and India were in 1968 when Auroville was founded, the world was living in compartments and in a state of cold war.
The idea of Auroville saw the world getting integrated by trade, travel and communication.
Auroville was conceived with the vision of enveloping the whole of humanity in one small area.
As the world progresses materially through science and technology, it will increasingly long for and need spiritual orientation for social order and stability.
At Auroville, the material and the spiritual, co-exist in harmony.
The fifth basic principle of Auroville is that it will be a place of un-ending learning and constant progress, so that it never stagnates.
The progress of humanity calls for continuous thinking and re-thinking, so that the human mind does not become frozen into one idea.
The very fact that Auroville has brought together such huge diversity of people and ideas makes dialogue and debate natural.
Indian society is fundamentally diverse.
It has fostered dialogue and a philosophic tradition.
Auroville show-cases this ancient Indian tradition to the world by bringing together global diversity.
India has always allowed mutual respect and co-existence of different religions and cultures.
Auroville too has developed as a place of un-ending and life-long education.
In ancient times, our sages and ‘Rishis’ would perform ‘yagya’ to begin great endeavours.
Occasionally, those yagyas would shape the course of history.
One such ‘Yagna’ for unity was performed here exactly 50 years ago.
Men and Women brought soils from all parts of the world.
In the mixing of the soils, began the journey of one-ness.
The world has received positive vibrations from Auroville, in many forms, over the years.
You have done a lot to promote quality education in the country.
On the occasion of 50 years of Auroville, I hope you can enhance your efforts in this direction.
Serving young minds through education will be a big tribute to Sri Aurobindo and the Mother.
Many of you may not be aware, but I too, have been a follower of your efforts on education.
Shri Kireet Bhai Joshi, an ardent disciple of Sri Aurobindo, and the Mother, was an eminent educationist.
He was also my Education Advisor, when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.
He is not amongst us today.
But his contribution to the field of education in India, is worth remembering.
May Auroville continue to come up with ideas to empower the ordinary citizens of this country.
May people from far and wide bring with them new ideas.
May Auroville become the centre where these ideas are synthesized.
May Auroville serve as a beacon to the world.
May it be the guardian which calls for breaking down narrow walls of the mind.
May it continue to invite everyone to celebrate the possibilities of humanity’s one-ness.

I congratulate all those who will be voting for the first time in the 2019 Parliamentary polls.
It is trust and optimism that will take our nation forward.

India is seeing remarkable progress in the last four years.
In all spheres, investment, steel sector, start ups, milk and agriculture, aviation, India’s progress is outstanding.
In hating Modi, the Opposition has begun to hate the nation.

In their 55 years, sanitation coverage was around 38% and in our 55 months it is nearly 98%.
The people of India have seen the work a Government with a full majority can do.
They have seen the work of NDA.
They do not want a महामिलावट Government of those who assembled in Kolkata.
During the CWG 2010, our players were playing hard to win medals for India.
But, for Congress, Commonwealth Games were an opportunity to boost personal wealth of a few in the Party.
The phone banking of the UPA did wonders for the friends of their leaders.
Due to such favouritism, our banking system witnessed many problems.
I want to say it on the floor of the Parliament that the Indian National Congress does not want our armed forces to be strong.
They do not want our security apparatus to be strong.

Dr.BabasahebAmbedkar was always ahead of his time.
He had said that joining Congress is like committing suicide.
Thousands of organisations were getting funds from overseas.
We sought transparency in the process but these organisations shut down.
Why was such money allowed to come in without accountability?
Price rise and Congress are a team.
When Congress comes, so does rising prices.

Our Government has worked towards the good health and wellbeing of the people of India.

I have had similar privilege in other Parliaments.
It is a great honour for the 1.25 billion people of India.
I carry their greetings and warm wishes of friendship with me to this House and for all the people of Uganda.
Every time I come to Uganda, I am enchanted by this “Pearl of Africa”.
It is a land of immense beauty, great wealth of resources and rich heritage.
Its rivers and lakes have nurtured civilisations across this large region.
I am conscious of the history that brings us to this point, when the Prime Minister of the largest democracy is speaking to elected Members of the Parliament of another sovereign nation.
Our ancient maritime links, the dark ages of colonial rule, the shared struggle for freedom, the uncertain paths as independent countries in a divided world, the dawn of the new opportunities and the unity of aspirations of our young population.
All of these connect us.
Our people are among the many threads that connect Uganda and India together.
Over a century ago, the heroic labour connected Uganda to the shores of the Indian Ocean through railway.
Your gracious presence today speaks of the precious bonds of friendship and solidarity between our people.
You have brought peace and stability to your nation and to the region.
You have put it on the path of growth and progress amidst many challenges.
In opening the State House to the celebration of Deepawali, you have lit up the many strands of ties that connect India and Uganda.
Among these, the most sacred is the site at Jinja, at the source of River Nile, where a portion of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were immersed.
In his life and beyond, he is one with Africa and Africans.
And, at the sacred site in Jinja, where a statue of Gandhiji now stands, we will build a Gandhi Heritage Centre.
The story of India’s own freedom struggle is closely linked to Africa.
It is not just the 21 years that Gandhiji spent in Africa, or the First Non- Cooperation Movement he led.
For India, the moral principles of independence movement, or the peaceful means to pursue it, were not just confined to the boundaries of India or to the future of Indians.
It was a universal quest for liberty, dignity, equality and opportunity for every human being.
Nowhere did it apply more than in Africa.
Twenty years before our independence, the leaders of our National Movement had linked India’s freedom struggle to the fight against colonial rule around the world, especially Africa.
Even as India stood on the threshold of independence, the fate of Africa was not far from our minds.
Mahatma Gandhi firmly believed that India’s freedom will remain incomplete so long as Africa remains in bondage.
Free India did not forget his words.
India pursued Afro-Asian solidarity in Bandung.
We stood firm in opposition to apartheid in South Africa.
We took leading and bold positions in former Rhodesia – which is now known as Zimbabwe, in Guinea Bassau, Angola and Namibia.
Gandhiji’s peaceful resistance inspired leaders like Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, Albert Luthuli, Julius Nyrere and Kwame Nkrumah.
History is witness to the success of the ancient wisdom of India and Africa and the enduring strength of peaceful resistance.
Some of the most profound changes in Africa came through Gandhian methods.
India’s principled support to Africa’s liberation movements often came at a cost to our nation’s trade.
But, nothing mattered in comparison to Africa’s freedom.
Our economic and international partnerships over the past seven decades have been prompted as much by economic impulse as by the moral principles and emotional bonds.
We sought a fair and equitable access to markets and resources.
We fought together to make development the foundation of global trade.
And, we worked to diversify economic partnership between countries of the South.
Our doctors and teachers went to Africa not just to seek professional opportunities, but in solidarity with a common cause of development as free nations.
Let us fight for mutual prosperity together.”
Today, India and Africa stand on the threshold of a future of great promise: as confident, secure, youthful, innovative, and dynamic people.
Uganda is an example of Africa on the move.
It is witnessing increasing gender parity, rising educational and health standards, and expanding infrastructure and connectivity.
It is a region with growing trade and investment.
We are seeing a surge of innovation.
We in India rejoice in every African success, because of our deep bonds of friendships.
India is proud to be Africa’s partner.
And, Uganda is central to our commitment to the continent.
Yesterday, I announced two Lines of Credit for Uganda.
As in the past, we will continue to support the aspirations of the people of Uganda – in agriculture and healthcare, education and training, infrastructure and energy, capacity building in government and training in defence.
I compliment President Museveni and this House on the decision to join the International Solar Alliance.
As with Uganda, we have deepened our partnership and engagement across the vast expanse of Africa.
In the past four years, our President, Vice President and I have collectively visited no less than 25 countries in Africa.
Our Ministers have covered virtually all African nations.
We were honoured to host all 54 countries – over 40 at Heads of State and Government level – at the third Africa-India Forum Summit in October 2015.
We were also privileged to host many African leaders for the inaugural summit of the International Solar Alliance.
And we are also opening 18 new embassies in Africa.
Our development partnership currently includes implementation of 180 Lines of Credit worth about USD 11 billion in over 40 African countries.
At the last India Africa Forum Summit, we had committed a concessional Line of Credit of 10 billion U.S. dollars and 600 million dollars in grant assistance.
Every year, over 8000 African youth are trained in a diverse set of programmes.
As always, our efforts will be driven by your priorities.
Indian companies have invested over US$ 54 billion in Africa.
Our trade with Africa is now over US$ 62 billion.
This is over 21 per cent more than in the previous year.
Africa’s exports to India are growing.
And, our economic ties are now increasingly driven by new partnerships of innovation in the digital economy.
It can become the new backbone for digital innovation in Africa.
And, India’s medicines turned the tide on diseases that were once a threat to Africa’s future.
They also continue to make healthcare affordable and accessible to many.
As we work together for prosperity, we have stood together for peace.
Indian soldiers have served in blue helmets so that Africa’s children can look to a future of peace.
We are proud of the work of Indian peacekeepers in over a dozen UN peacekeeping missions in Africa, since our first mission in Congo in 1960.
In all the UN peacekeeping Missions in the world, 163 Indians have made the supreme sacrifice.
This is among the highest number for any country.
Almost 70 per cent of these embraced martyrdom just in Africa.
Today, over 6,000 Indians serve in five peacekeeping operations in Africa.
Indian women established a landmark with the first all-female Police Unit of the United Nations in Liberia.
Our defence and security cooperation is growing with nations in Africa, as we work together to counter terrorism and piracy, and keep our seas secure.
India’s engagement with Africa will continue to be guided by 10 principles.
One, Africa will be at the top of our priorities.
We will continue to intensify and deepen our engagement with Africa.
As we have shown, it will be sustained and regular.
Two, our development partnership will be guided by your priorities.
We will rely on African talent and skills.
We will build as much local capacity and create as many local opportunities as possible.
Three, we will keep our markets open and make it easier and more attractive to trade with India.
We will support our industry to invest in Africa.
We will work with you to improve Africa’s agriculture.
Six, our partnership will address the challenges of climate change.
We will work with Africa to ensure a just international climate order; to preserve our biodiversity; and, adopt clean and efficient energy sources.
Nine, and, this is especially important to me: as global engagement in Africa increases, we must all work together to ensure that Africa does not once again turn into a theatre of rival ambitions, but becomes a nursery for the aspirations of Africa’s youth.
India’s own quest for reforms in the global institutions is incomplete without an equal place for Africa.
That will be a key purpose of our foreign policy.
India will work with you and for you.
We will speak for you, and with you.
Two-thirds of India and two-thirds of Africa is under the age of 35 years.
And, if the future belongs to the youth, then this century is ours to shape and build.
And, let us be guided by the Ugandan saying that is – “Anayejitahidi hufaidi” which means “one who makes the extra effort will benefit”.

It will further facilitate competition, efficiency in operations and improvement in quality of supply of electricity.
He said unity is the basic requirement for this.
He said we must make a conscious effort to preserve our unity.
The voice is of 125 crore Indians.
NEIDS is a combination of the incentives covered under the earlier two schemes with a much larger outlay.
In order to promote employment in the North East States, Government is incentivizing primarily the MSME Sector through this scheme.
Government is also providing specific incentive through the scheme to generate employment.
All eligible industrial units, which are getting benefits of one or more components of other schemes of the Government of India, will also be considered for benefits of other components of this scheme.
On this occasion, the Central Government has also handed over the existing hospital, the medical college, and related buildings to the Government of Tamil Nadu.
It reinforces my government’s commitment to co-operative federalism.
I hope that the Government of Tamil Nadu will act quickly to start the College.
This project worth 580 crore rupees will be a boon to ESIC beneficiaries and their family members in and around Coimbatore.
Of the 100 MBBS seats proposed here, 20 seats will be reserved for the children of persons insured under the ESI scheme.
We should strive to make this medical college and hospital a model for high quality medical education and treatment to workers of the State.
My government is committed to the development of a generous and comprehensive social safety net for all workers.
For the over 45 crores unorganized sector workers, we have, in addition to the RSBY health insurance program, started the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, and the Atal Pension Yojana to provide life and accident insurance.
This commitment to the builders of modern India comes from the firm belief that a ‘Swasth and Samridh Shramik will make a Samridh Rashtra’.
We have initiated major reforms of the EPFO and ESIC for the benefit of organized sector employees.
A Universal Account Number has so far been allotted to over 6 crore sector workers, enabling portability of their EPF accounts.
Further, we propose to expand coverage and offer additional facilities and services through the ESIC.
The ESI Scheme is based on the Gandhian principle of “contributions as per the ability and benefits as per the requirement” .
This principle entitles an insured person or their family members to uniform benefits though only paying a contribution proportionate to his or her wage.
It is available in 31 districts of Tamil Nadu.
There are ten ESI hospitals in Tamil Nadu.
After handing over this hospital, there will be eight ESI Hospitals in the state run by the State Government.
The ESIC Hospital Tirunelveli is proposed for upgradation from 50 to 100 beds.
There is a large network of 210 ESI dispensaries in the State for out-patient treatment for the insured persons and their family members.
Coimbatore itself has 50 dispensaries.
The coverage of ESI scheme has been extended to the remaining North-East States Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Manipur and Andaman & Nicobar Island.
It is proposed to expand the coverage from only the industrial and commercial clusters within a district to the entire district by 31st March this year.
Since 1st August last year, the scheme has been extended to construction workers.
I strongly believe in the improvement of public service delivery standards.
In keeping with this, several initiatives have been started to improve the quality of service delivery in ESI hospitals.
They include online availability of electronic health record of ESI beneficiaries, establishment of an emergency medical helpline, and creation of special outpatient services for senior citizens and differently-abled persons in ESIC hospitals.
To improve cleanliness, the Abhiyan Indradhanush changes bedsheets according to the rainbow pattern each day of the week.
Among other initiatives, the ESIC has resolved to adopt two model hospitals in each State, apart from a mother and child care hospital.
I am happy that ESIC proposes to expand coverage by complementing its own services with Public Private Partnerships.
Apart from cancer detection, cardiology treatment, and dialysis, the Corporation also proposes to offer in a phased manner pathological and X-ray facilities in all its dispensaries through PPPs.
Besides allopathic treatment, ESIC hospitals will also provide AYUSH treatment in a phased manner.
Friends, my Government has taken a number of path-breaking steps for the welfare of workforce of our country.
From September 2014, we have revised the Employee Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) pension to a minimum of 1000 rupees per month.
The wage ceiling for EPF benefits has been raised from 6500 to 15000 rupees.
Namely, on wages, industrial relations, safety and security, and health.
A Shram Suvidha Portal has been created for online services related to 16 labor laws, including administering a process of transparent and random inspections of businesses.
A LIN number has been issued to nearly one million employers, enabling them to process single online filings on eight labour laws.
Our plans to expand ESIC facilities, indeed the establishment of this medical college itself, is part of a larger plan to upgrade the facilities for medical education and specialized tertiary care.
We have also approved a scheme for up-gradation of existing State and Central Government medical colleges to increase MBBS seats.
So far 23 medical colleges have been approved to increase over 1,700 MBBS seats.
I am happy to inform that four state government medical colleges in Tamil Nadu at Coimbatore, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Madurai have been approved for upgradation by adding 345 more MBBS seats.
With similar objective, we are also promoting the establishment of AIIMS like institutions across the country.
Friends, we all know that the Father of the Constitution is Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
But not many of us are aware of the immense contribution made by Babasaheb to the formulation of our Labour Laws.
I am therefore happy to inform that Ministry of Labour & Employment organized a conference in Delhi last month to commemorate the 125th Birth Anniversary Year of Dr Ambedkar.
I urge each one of you to read the booklet “Dr B R Ambedkar – Labour Welfare & Empowerment: Initiatives to make his vision a reality” which was released on that occasion.
We are committed to resolve to work collectively and collaboratively to realize the vision of Dr. Ambedkar for labour welfare.
Friends, industrial peace and harmony can be achieved only when the goals of employment and employability are in tune with the goals of industrial development and growth.
It is our shared vision to have an environment which is conducive for inclusive growth and development of the country.
I assure the state government all the cooperation from the central government in all its efforts in this direction.
Let us all come together in making our country the best place to work and live in.

He said that Yoga could lead to a calm, creative and content life, removing tensions and needless anxiety.

Instead of further animosity, Yoga assimilates.
• The National Mission for Financial Inclusion (PMJDY) to continue beyond 14.8.2018
• Existing Over Draft (OD) limit of Rs 5,000 to be raised to Rs 10,000.
• There will not be any conditions attached for OD upto Rs 2,000.
• Age limit for availing OD facility to be revised from 18-60 years to 18-65 years.
It will, thus, bring them into the mainstream of financial services and will facilitate transfer of benefits of various subsidy schemes of the Government more efficiently.
• Banking Correspondents (BCs) have been deployed in 1.26 lakh Sub Service Areas (rural areas), each catering to 1000-1500 households.
Nearly 13.16 crore Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) transactions have taken place through BCs during the month of July, 2018.
A pipeline has been created for the implementation of PMJDY through which JanDhan accounts and mobile banking have been linked to Aadhaar (JAM).
This pipeline is not only facilitating savings, disbursal of credit, social security, etc. but more importantly channelizing direct benefits of various government schemes to poor people of the country through DBT.
It has been decided to continue the flagship financial inclusion program (PMJDY), with focus on opening accounts from “every household to every adult”.
With a view to increase banking penetration, promote financial inclusion and to provide at least one bank account per household across the country, a National Mission on Financial Inclusion known as Pradhan Mantri JanDhan Yojana (PMJDY) was announced by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in his Independence Day Speech on 15thAugust, 2014.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.
The Rajasthan Refinery will be the State’s first.
I have the opportunity to be amongst you to share my Mann Ki Baat once again.
Far south, the people are engrossed in Onam festivities and yesterday the entire Nation celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The government of India has launched various schemes of social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time all these schemes have been accepted in large numbers.
I had made a humble request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan we give our sisters these insurance schemes as a gift.
The preliminary information that I have, notifies me that from launch till date around 11 crore families have joined this scheme.
And I have been told that almost half the beneficiaries are women, the mothers and the daughters.
I consider this as a positive sign.
I offer my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on this blessed occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I saw the richness of the poor.
Banks are the mainstream of the economy and to reach this facility to the homes of the poor, the programme of Bank Mitra is being strengthened.
Today more than 1.25 lakh Bank Mitras are serving in the country.
The youth have got employment this way.
Now the poor have this faith that they too can get money from the bank.
I would again like to congratulate all the people associated with this initiative and I would like to request the poor brethren who have opened an account to never severe this relationship.
These are your banks and now you should never leave them.
I have brought them to you, now it is your job to keep them going.
All of our accounts should be kept active.
I have the faith that you will definitely continue operating the bank accounts.
In the past few days the events in Gujarat, the violence unsettled the entire country.
It is natural that if something of this sort happens in the land of Mahatma and Sardar Patel, then the Nation is definitely shocked and hurt.
But in a very short span of time, the intelligent brothers and sisters of mine in Gujarat brought the entire situation under control.
They played an important role in preventing the situation form worsening further and once again Gujarat started its peaceful march.
Development is the key to our problems.
And truly speaking of the experience and the manner in which they presented their views sounded as if some music was being played.
Their choice of words, their way of talking, the generosity of the Sufi tradition, its sublimity, its lyricism, I could experience it all.
I think it has become imperative to present Islam in its true form to the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition which is associated with love and generosity will take this message far and wide and will thus benefit not only the humanity but also benefit Islam.
And I would like to tell all that whatever faith one follows, we should definitely experience Sufism once.
I am about to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider myself fortunate to receive this invitation.
Various Buddhist scholars from across the globe are coming together at Bodh Gaya and will discuss issues relating to humanity at a global level.
I have been extended an invitation to be a part of this event and I am glad to be invited at Bodh Gaya.
Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India visited Bodh Gaya.
And now, I will be going there with these scholars, this gives me immense happiness.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, today I would again like to especially share my Mann Ki Baat with you.
I have already mentioned this in the previous sessions of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me speak in the parliament, in public forums or Mann Ki Baat about it.
I have always said that the government is open to all views and suggestions on the issue of Land Acquisition Act, on which a debate is going on.
I have reiterated again and again that I am open to any suggestion in the interest of the farmers.
But today, I want to tell all my farmer brothers and sisters that the request to reform the ‘Land Acquisition Act’ was raised by the states very emphatically.
Everyone felt that if the welfare of the farmers is to be achieved, if the water has to reach the fields, if poles are to be erected to provide electricity, if roads have to be constructed in the village, if houses are to be made for the poor in the village, if employment opportunities are to be provided to the poor youth of rural areas then we have to free the land from legal hassles and bureaucratic hurdles.
And hence this reformed proposal was introduced.
But I saw how the framers were being misled and a fear psychosis created.
My dear farmers, you should not be misled and definitely never be scared.
And I do not wish to give anyone the opportunity to mislead you and scare you.
For me, every single voice in the Nation is important but most important to me is the voice of the farmer.
I have decided that let this ordinance be lapsed.
This means that now same situation exists as it was prior to the formation of my government.
But in the same act, there was a job which was incomplete.
The guiding mantra is the welfare of the villages and the poor farmers.
That is why I declared on 15th August that it is not just an agricultural department but an agricultural and farmer welfare department will be created.
We are steadily working on it.
So my dear farmers there is no need to be misled now and especially there is no need for you to fear anything.
Do not be scared even if someone tries to scare you.
I have to say something more.
Two days back we completed the 50 years of the 1965 war.
And whenever we talk of the 65 war it is natural that we remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also but natural that we remember his slogan ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisan’.
May we continue to be inspired by such incidents of our history.
Like I had the chance of meeting the Sufi scholars similarly I had another great experience.
I had the opportunity to interact for hours with the distinguished scientists of the country.
I had the opportunity to hear them and I was very happy to know that India is doing commendable research in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing some excellent work.
And I saw how the young scientists were eager to explain their work and their eyes were full of dreams.
In the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat I had expressed the view that our students should be drawn towards science.
After this meeting I felt that there are numerous options and endless possibilities.
I receive many letters from the citizens.
And when they do get the interview letter – the poor, the widowed mother start thinking who to reach for recommendation, who can help get the job, whose jack could be useful to get that job.
I do not know what all kind of words are being used?
Every one rushes and that seems to be one reason for corruption at the lower levels.
I had mentioned in my speech on 15th August 2015 that this tradition of interview should at least end at some level.
I am happy that in such a short span of time, it has just been 15 days but the government is moving at a very fast pace.
Information is being disseminated and soon the decision will be enforced and small jobs will be made free of interviews.
These days many guests from foreign countries have arrived in India.
24 countries from across the globe discussed on the Indian soil a ‘Call to Action’ to reduce Maternal Mortality and Infant Mortality rates.
It was the first time that this programme was organized in any other country outside America.
And it is true that in our country about 50,000 mothers and almost 13 lakh children die during delivery or immediately after it every year.
This is a cause of worry and these figures are scary.
Like we became polio free similarly we became free from tetanus as a cause of maternal and child mortality.
But we still have to work to save our mothers and our children.
Dear countrymen, there is news of dengue everywhere.
It is directly related to the Swachh Bharat Campaign that I talk about.
There are several ways of keeping the smallest thing in the household clean by using pure water.
A lot of Public Education Programmes are being conducted but we do not pay attention.
We feel that we live in very good houses with proper arrangements being totally unaware that water is collecting at some location in the house and that we are inviting dengue.
I would request you all that do not make death so cheap.
A little carelessness about cleanliness and accumulated water can cause death, which I believe is not right.
In the entire country about 514 centers have facilities for testing dengue cases absolutely free of cost.
It is necessary to get ourselves tested on time to save precious lives.
Cooperation from all of you is very important for this menace.
And cleanliness should be given great importance.
From Raksha Bandhan to Diwali there will be many festivals.
Why don’t we associate each festival with cleaniness?
You will see how a tradition becomes your habit.
My dear countrymen I want to share good news with you.
Like I said we may not get a chance to die for our Nation, but we can be fortunate to live for the country.
These two brothers have brought pride to the Nation.
But I was happier to know that they do all this for their campaign “Team India – Vision for Tribals”.
See everyone is doing their bit for taking the country forward.
And this it, when you hear such things the heart swells with pride.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth guided by a certain perception.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth we learn so many things.
I have met so many youth who have taken the pledge ‘Sunday on Cycle’.
Some say that I keep one day a week as Cycle-Day as it is good for my health.
It is good for the environment.
And I enjoy my youth too.
Nowadays many cities in our country are witnessing cycle use and there are many people promoting its use.
But this is a good initiative both for improving health and saving the environment.
And today when two youths of my country made India proud in the US, I thought of it worth mentioning.
Today I especially want to congratulate the Maharashtra government.
But along with this, the house in UK where Baba Saheb lived – 10 King Henry Road has been purchased too.
The globetrotting Indians on their trip to UK can visit the memorial being erected by the Maharashtra government.
It will be inspirational to many.
I congratulate the Maharashtra government on the accomplishment of both these tasks.
My dear brothers and sisters do share your views before the next Mann Ki Baat for I believe that democracy runs through public participation.
We can take the Nation forward when we work together.
I send my best wishes to you.
He said that when change happens, it becomes apparent for all to see.
He added that the organization of such a big investors’ summit in Uttar Pradesh, with the participation of so many investors, is itself indicative of change.
He congratulated the State for establishing itself on the path of development and prosperity in such a short timeframe.
He said the State is blessed with an abundance of resources and capabilities.
He said the Union Government’s schemes such as Skill India Mission, Stand Up India, Start Up India and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, will prove useful in implementing the “One District, One Product” scheme.
He said the Union Government’s Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Scheme would help reduce wastage in the agriculture sector.

My dear countrymen, I’m fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme.
Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru.
Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan’s first international match and it’s a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India.
I’m also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills”.
Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan.
This match will remain etched in our memories for a long time.
Anyway, being the first match, it is naturally memorable, but I will cherish it for a special reason.
The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world.
What does a winning team do while receiving the trophy?
The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs.
This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship.
Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents & skills of our youth.
I felicitate both the teams of India & Afghanistan.
I sincerely hope, that in future too, we’ll play with each other with the best sportsman spirit & shine together.
My dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights.
The whole world appeared as one entity.
Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women.
On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison.
Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people.
Zealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival.
If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over?
It is a matter of great pride for a hundred & twenty five crore people to witness members of our armed forces perform yoga on land, sea & sky.
A section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines; some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of Siachen for the same.
Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth.
Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air.
Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues.
Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets; yoga has proved them in a concrete manner.
I believe that the concept of wellness today is bringing about a revolution.
I hope the campaign of wellness through yoga will gain further momentum.
More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives.
You are absolutely right.
We think of doctors only during times of distress.
But this is a day when the nation celebrates the achievements of our doctors and expresses gratitude for their spirit of service and commitment towards society.
We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life.
On the other hand, there are times when it is the Doctor who gives us re-birth.
They not only cure but also heal.
Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise; they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health.
Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills.
Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems.
Through Mann Ki Baat I extend my warmest felicitations on behalf of the countrymen to all our doctors, ahead of Doctor’s Day on the 1st of July.
My dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India.
Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar?
In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in one’s pathway to heaven.
He toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times.
These were his ideals.
The true saint is the one who recognizes & understands the sufferings of others.
Those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive, uncompassionate.
Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion.
He was a thinker way ahead of his times.
He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries.
Wherever he went, he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour.
Who can forget that dark day of April 13, 1919, when abusing all limits of power, crossing all the boundaries of cruelty; theguiltless, unarmed and innocent people were fired upon.
It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end!
Very few people would also be knowing that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Kolkata University in Bangla.
This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries minister of India and, in a sense, helaid a strong foundation for India’s industrial development, he had prepared a solid base, it was he who had prepared a stout platform.
The first industrial policy of Independent India, which came in 1948, was stamped with his ideas and vision.
Dr. Mukherjee’s dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere.
He had wanted India to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to MSME, handloom, textiles and cottage industry.
He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal.
It was the result of his understanding, prudence and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.
I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them.
People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements.
When I would listen to the stories of a common man, his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart.
In far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers.
At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur ; And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people.
Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school’s tinkering lab.
I am glad that in this entire programme I witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government, of the country’s power, the power of New India’s dreams, the power of the resolve of the new India – this is what I experienced!
There are certain people in society, who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views, their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite.
In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government’s credit.
An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength.
I again want to express my gratitude to you all.
We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness.
Now you must be wondering that these are two completely different occupations – what is the relation between these professions?
But there exists a link, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers came along and created an effortless ‘Samridhi trust’ with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust.
This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers.
The training to inculcate organic farming while teaching latest agricultural techniques and how to grow more crops along with a single cash crop in the fields was imparted through the professional, engineers and technocrats associated with this trust started giving training to the farmers.
The farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits, today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust.
Farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust.
‘One Nation, One Tax’ was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today.
If I’ve to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of ‘One Nation One Tax reform’, then I credit the states of our nation.
GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country.
In the GST scheme,information technology has replaced the inspector.
Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology.
GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world.
The successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in India was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses, fuelled the success of the GST scheme.
It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption.
However within a year, the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation, the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself, has achieved stability and according to the need, it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement.
This is a huge success in itself which 125 crore Indians have earned for themselves.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for leasing out 1.61 acres of land bearing khasara No.91/15 located at Alipur Delhi, owned by Delhi Milk Scheme to Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) for setting up of KisanMandi.

At the Ufa Summit last year, conducted so ably by President Putin, the SCO leaders had accepted India as its full member.
It was a landmark in India’s engagement with SCO.
Later today, we will sign the Memorandum of Obligations.
With this we would formalize the process of India’s membership of the SCO.
And, as a logical extension India’s age old ties with the region, one-sixth of humanity will join the family of SCO.
We are indeed grateful to the SCO Member States and its leaders for their overwhelming support for India’s membership of the SCO.
Our historic linkages with you are centuries old.
And, its just not geography that connects us.
Our societies have been enriched by links of culture, cusine and commerce.
They form the bed rock of our modern day relationships with Russia, China and the countries of Central Asia.
With India as its full member, SCO boundaries would stretch from the Pacific to Europe; and from the Arctic to the Indian Ocean.
To this group, India brings principles that are in tune with the philosophies of the SCO.
India has always enjoyed good relations with the Eurasian land mass.
We also share global goals of stability, security and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific.
India would no doubt benefit from SCO’s strengths in energy, natural resources and industry.
In turn, India’s strong economy and its vast market could drive economic growth in the SCO region.
India’s capacities in trade, investments, information and communication technology, Space, S&T, agriculture, health care, small and medium scale industry can bring wide spread economic benefit to the SCO countries.
We can partner to develop human resources and institutional capacities in the region.
Since our priorities match, our development experiences would be relevant to your national needs.
The interdependent world of twenty-first century is full of economic opportunities.
It also faces geo-political complexities and security challenges.
And, not just physical connectivity.
What we need is seamless flow of goods, services, capital and people among ourselves.
But, that alone is not enough.
Our region also needs to nurture strong rail, road and air links with the rest of the world.
Within SCO, India will be a productive partner in building strong trade, transport, energy, digital and people to people links.
Our decision to join the international North South Transport Corridor, the Chabahar Agreement, and Ashgabat Agreement reflects this desire and intent.
India’s membership of SCO would contribute to region’s prosperity.
It would also strengthen its security.
Our partnership will protect our societies from the threats of radical ideologies of hate, violence and terror.
India will unite with SCO countries to work towards this goal.
And, we will adopt zero tolerance and a comprehensive approach in fighting terrorism at all levels.
In conclusion Mr. Chairman,
Next year, we look forward to attending SCO meeting in Astana, as equal partners.
I wish all success to Kazhakstan in their Chairmanship of SCO in 2017.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Parents in most parts of the country must be busy with their children’s examinations.
There would be a sense of relief where the examinations are over, but where the examinations are still on, there certainly would still be some amount of pressure.
However, at a time like this I would only say that students may listen again to what I had said in my ‘Mann Ki Baat’ last time.
I am sure that my suggestions there will be of substantial help while they sit for their examinations.
Today is the 26th of March.
26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
It was a historic war against injustice, which was fought under the leadership of “Banga-Bandhu” and led to the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh, on this significant day.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are a shared heritage.
The National Anthem of Bangladesh too, has been composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
There is a very interesting fact about Gurudev that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize, but Knighthood was also conferred upon him by the British.
The inhuman massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh, provided a new inspiration and mission in life to that young teenager, who until then had spent his days playing merrily in his fields.
And Bhagat, that 12-year old boy in 1919, evolved to be the martyr Bhagat Singh, our dear hero and inspiration.
They had sublimated all their dreams for the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes inspire us to this day.
It would be impossible to express in words the story of the supreme sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
And the entire British Empire feared these three young men.
They were in jail, certain to be hanged, but still the British remained anxious about how to deal with them.
That is why, though the scheduled date was the 24th, they were hanged on the 23rd of March.
This was done clandestinely, which is not the usual practice.
And later, their remains were brought to present day Punjab, and were secretly cremated.
Many years ago, when I first got the chance to go there, I could feel a certain vibration in that place.
And I would certainly urge the youth of our country to go to Punjab, whenever they get the chance, and visit the ‘samadhi’ of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh’s mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
That was the period when the desire for freedom, its intensity, and spread were on the rise.
On the one hand, brave hearts like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, were inspiring the youth towards an armed revolution.
And on the other hand, exactly one hundred years ago on the 10th of April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had launched the Champaran Satyagraha.
This year marks the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha.
In India’s struggle for freedom, Gandhian thought and Gandhian practice became manifest for the first time in Champaran.
This was a turning point in the entire journey of India’s freedom struggle, especially in the context of the methodology of the struggle.
This was the period when, in the Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, and the mill-workers’ strike in Ahmedabad, the deep impact of Mahatma Gandhi’s thoughts and practices was amply and clearly visible.
Gandhi returned to India in 1915, and in 1917, he went to a small village in Bihar and gave the country a new inspiration.
We cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi that we cherish in our hearts today.
Just imagine that one man, who came to India in 1915, and had been in the country for barely two years.
The country didn’t know of him, he bore no influence then; it was just the beginning.
We can only imagine the hardships that he must have endured, how hard he must have had to toil.
But if we reflect upon the Gandhi of a hundred years ago, the Gandhi of the Champaran Satyagraha, that would be a subject of deep study for anyone about to enter public life.
We can all learn from Gandhi Ji what it means to begin a life of public service, how hard one has to work, as Gandhi did.
And that was the period when all the stalwarts, that we hear about today: Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Ji, and others were all sent to the villages by Gandhi Ji.
Ways and means to connect with the people and lending hues of freedom to their day to day work were taught.
In a way, Gandhi created two sides of the same coin; one being struggle and the other, creativity.
To get themselves arrested voluntarily to fill jails, on the one hand, and on the other to immerse themselves in creative work.
Gandhi’s style of working had an incredible balance.
What the word, ‘Satyagraha’ means, what disagreement can mean, what Non-Cooperation in the face of such a vast Empire could be –Gandhi Ji established a completely new vision of resistance, not through mere words, but through a successful experiment.
Today, as the nation observes the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha, the immense power of the common man, so visible in the struggle for freedom, manifests again in the journey from Swaraj to Suraaj, the resolve, the perseverance of the 125 crore countrymen, following the tenet of ‘Sarvyajan Hitaay, Sarvajan Sukhaay’ i.e. for the benefit of all, for the happiness of all, and the ceaseless enterprise to achieve something for the country, the society, would bring about the realisation of the dreams of the great souls who laid down their lives for the sake of Freedom.
Today, as we live in the 21st century, which Indian wouldn’t want to see India change, which Indian wouldn’t want to be a partner in the transformation of the country!
This desire of 125 crore countrymen for change, the effort to change, is what will lay a strong foundation of a ‘New India’.
‘New India’ is neither a government programme, nor is it the manifesto of a political party, nor is it a project.
‘New India’ is the clarion call of 125 crore countrymen.
It is the essence of the emotions of the 125 crore Indians wanting to come together and create a magnificent India.
125 crore Indians nurture a hope, a zeal, a resolve, a desire.
There are many who regularly go to hospitals to serve patients.
There are many who rush to donate blood, when required.
If we look at it in its collectiveness, in an organised manner, it comes across as a major force.
When there is a talk of ‘New India’, its criticism, its analysis, it counter views, are but natural, and that is a fundamental of democracy.
But it is true that if 125 crore countrymen resolve, and decide to walk step by step on a path to realise that resolve, the dream of ‘New India’ can be fulfilled in our lifetime.
And all these things are not necessarily achieved through the Budget, government projects, or government money.
In essence, every citizen must discharge his civic duties and responsibilities.
This in itself would be a good beginning to the New India.
As India gets ready to celebrate 75 years of Independence in 2022, come let us remember Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru.
Let us remember the Champaran Satyagraha.
We can do this in our day to day lives.
Each and every one of them also resolved to carry this mission forward.
I believe that in whatever time that is left before Baba Saheb Ambedkar’s birth anniversary, we should popularise and promote the BHIM-App.
We should contribute towards ensuring reducing the use of cash, of currency notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time, I request people for suggestions in Mann Ki Baat, numerous suggestions pour in.
But I have seen that there is always an emphasis on the topic of cleanliness.
Gayatri, a young girl from Dehradun, who is a student of class 11, has phoned in with a message: –
“Esteemed Principal, Prime Minister Sir, my respectful greetings to you.
To begin with, heartiest congratulations on your victory in the elections, with a huge margin.
I wish to share the issue close to my heart with you.
I want to say that people will have to be made aware about the importance of cleanliness.
Every day I pass by a river, in which people dump a lot of garbage and pollute rivers.
The river flows under the Rispana Bridge before passing by my home.
For the sake of this river we went to settlements on its banks, spoke to people and took out rallies too, but to no avail.
I want to request you to kindly highlight this issue by sending a team there, or through the newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, look at the agony of this young daughter, the 11th class student.
How enraged she is by seeing the river strewn with trash.
I consider this to be a good omen.
This is exactly what I want – – that 125 crore countrymen be angered by filth.
Once there is anger, dissatisfaction, rage, we will be compelled to act against this scourge.
The good thing is that Gayatri is expressing her own anger, and giving suggestions to me, but she also goes on to say, that she has made several efforts but could not succeed.
There has been an awareness ever since the launch of the Cleanliness Movement.
Each person has become associated with it in a positive manner.
This has now truly taken the form of a movement.
There has been an increase in the disgust towards squalor.
When there is awareness and active participation in the movement, it has its own significance.
But cleanliness is more about a habit than a movement.
This movement is geared towards bringing about a change in the habit, a movement to inculcate the HABIT of cleanliness.
This movement can be accomplished collectively.
It is a difficult task, but we have to do it.
I am sure that this resolve that has arisen in the younger generation, in children, in students, in the youth, augurs well for achieving good results.
I would urge my fellow countrymen, who have heard Gayatri’s message in my ‘Mann Ki Baat’ today, that it should be a message to all of us.
We put each and everything on offer, on our plates, but we fail to finish what we have taken.
We can’t even finish half of what is on our plates and then leave it uneaten.
Have you ever thought about how much food we waste?
Have you ever thought how many poor people can be fed if we don’t thus waste our food?
This is not something that needs to be taught.
As it is, in our families, mothers always tell their children to take only as much food they can eat.
There is always some effort made in this direction, but still the apathy on this issue is a crime against society.
It is an injustice to the poor.
On the other hand, if we are able to avoid wastage, the family too benefits economically.
So while it is good to care about society, this is beneficial to the family as well.
I am not urging too much on this issue, but I would like this awareness to spread.
I do know some young persons, who are active in such campaigns.
They work hard, and these are our own young people.
You will find such people somewhere in each and every state of India.
The lives of these people can inspire us not to waste food.
We should take only as much as we can eat.
See, these are the pathways leading towards change.
And those who are health conscious always say that, there should always be some space left both in the stomach and on the plate.
Now that we are talking about health, 7th April is World Health Day.
United Nations has resolved to provide universal health coverage for all by 2030.
We are familiar with this word, depression.
According to one estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world suffer from depression.
I want to tell my countrymen, that depression is not incurable.
There is a need to create a psychologically conducive environment to begin with.
Share openly what you are going through, with your colleagues, friends, parents, brothers, and teachers.
Sometimes one is overcome by a sense of loneliness – – – students living in hostels are particularly vulnerable to it.
Have you ever wondered why he does so?
You can be sure that this the first step towards depression.
If he prefers to stay away from a group, and tends to be all by himself, do make an effort to ensure that this does not happen.
He should be given an opportunity to be amongst people with whom he speaks openly.
If you try to sympathise with the sufferings of others with a sense of service, a new self-confidence will be born within you.
By connecting with others, serving them and serving them selflessly, you will easily be able to shed the weight oppressing your own heart and mind.
Yoga too is a good means for mental wellbeing.
Yoga helps in relieving tension and stress, and leads one towards a happy state of mind.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga.
This will be the third year of its observance.
You all should start preparing for it right away.
Collective Yoga festivals should be celebrated with the participation of millions.
If you have any ideas for the Third International Yoga Day, please do send me your suggestions and guidance through my mobile Application.
You could compose as many songs and poems on Yoga, as possible, as these can be easily understood by the masses.
Recently, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The Government of India has taken a very important decision.
There are now only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this matter.
India has taken a very important decision for these working women sisters of ours.
That is how these children will become true assets of the country when they grow up.
Mothers too will remain healthy.
And that is why, this is such a landmark decision, and this will benefit 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
May the lives of all these great luminaries inspire us, and give us the strength to resolve ourselves to the cause of New India.
The new year is celebrated in different ways in different parts of our country.
New year is Gudi Padva in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, for the Sindhi it is Cheti Chand, Navreh in Kashmir, Samvatsar Pooja in the Awadh Region, Jud-Sheetal in the Mithila region of Bihar and the festival of Satuvani in the Magadh region.
India is a country blessed with rich diversity.
My heartiest greetings and best wishes to you all on this New Year.
Many thanks.
On Thursday, I had the privilege to host the ASEAN leaders for the Commemorative Summit to mark 25 years of ASEAN-India Partnership.
Their presence with us is an unprecedented gesture of goodwill from ASEAN nations.
Responding to this, on a winter morning, India has come out to greet them in a warm embrace of friendship.
The India-ASEAN partnership may be just 25 years old.
But, India’s ties with Southeast Asia stretch back more than two millennia.
Forged in peace and friendship, religion and culture, art and commerce, language and literature, these enduring links are now present in every facet of the magnificent diversity of India and Southeast Asia, providing a unique envelope of comfort and familiarity between our people.
More than two decades ago, India opened itself to the world with tectonic changes.
And, with instincts honed over centuries, it turned naturally to the East.
Thus began a new journey of India’s reintegration with the East.
For India, most of our major partners and markets — from ASEAN and East Asia to North America — lie to the East.
And, Southeast Asia and ASEAN, our neighbours by land and sea, have been the springboard of our Look East and, for the last three years, the Act East Policy.
Along the way, from dialogue partners, ASEAN and India have become strategic partners.
We advance our broad-based partnership through 30 mechanisms.
With each Asean member, we have growing diplomatic, economic and security partnership.
We work together to keep our seas safe and secure.
Our trade and investment flows have multiplied several times.
ASEAN is India’s fourth largest trading partner; India is ASEAN’s seventh.
Over 20% of India’s outbound investments go to ASEAN.
Led by Singapore, ASEAN is India’s leading source of investments.
India’s free trade agreements in the region are its oldest and among the most ambitious anywhere.
Over a 6 million strong Indian diaspora in the region — rooted in diversity and steeped in dynamism — constitutes an extraordinary human bond between us.
The Prime Minister has shared his views for each of the ASEAN member nations as follows
Thailand has emerged as an important trading partner of India in Asean and is also one of the important investors in India from Asean.
Bilateral trade between India and Thailand has more than doubled over the last decade.
Relations between India and Thailand are extensively spread across many areas.
We are important regional partners linking South and Southeast Asia.
We cooperate closely in the Asean, East Asia Summit and Bimstec (the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), as also in the frameworks of Mekong Ganga Cooperation, Asia Cooperation Dialogue and Indian Ocean Rim Association.
Thailand’s prime minister’s state visit to India in 2016 has made a long-lasting impact on bilateral relations.
The whole of India mourned with their Thai brothers and sisters the demise of the great and popular King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
The people of India also join the friendly people of Thailand in praying for the long, prosperous and peaceful reign of the new king, His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun.
The traditionally close and cordial relations have their historical roots in the common struggle for liberation from foreign rule and the national struggle for independence.
Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and President Hồ Chí Minh led our peoples in the heroic struggle against colonialism.
During the visit of Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng to India in 2007, we signed the Strategic Partnership agreement.
This strategic partnership has grown into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with my visit to Việt Nam in 2016.
India’s relations with Việt Nam are marked by growing economic and commercial engagement.
Bilateral trade between India and Việt Nam has increased about 10 fold in 10 years.
Defence Co-operation has emerged as a significant pillar of strategic partnership between India and Việt Nam.
Science and Technology is another important area of cooperation between India and Việt Nam.
India and Myanmar share a land-border of over 1600 kms as well as a maritime boundary.
Religious and cultural traditions flowing from our deep sense of kinship and our common Buddhist heritage bind us as closely as does our shared historical past.
Nothing illuminates it more gloriously than the gleaming tower of Shwedagon Pagoda.
The cooperation to restore Ananda Temple in Bagan with assistance of the Archaeological Survey of India also is emblematic of this shared heritage.
During the colonial period, political bonds were forged between our leaders, who displayed a great sense of hope and unity during our common struggle for independence.
Gandhiji visited Yangon several times.
Bal Gangadhar Tilak was deported to Yangon for many years.
The clarion call of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose for India’s independence stirred the souls of many in Myanmar.
Our trade has more than doubled over the last decade.
Our investment ties are also robust.
Development cooperation has a significant role in India’s relations with Myanmar.
This assistance portfolio is presently worth over $1.73 billion.
India’s transparent development cooperation is in line with Myanmar’s national priorities and also builds synergy with the Master Plan of ASEAN Connectivity.
Singapore is a window to the heritage of India’s ties to the region, the progress of the present and the potential of the future.
Singapore was a bridge between India and Asean.
Today, it is our gateway to the East, our leading economic partner and a major global strategic partner, which resonates in our membership in several regional and global forums.
Singapore and India share a strategic partnership.
Our political relations are infused with goodwill, warmth and trust.
Our defence ties are among the strongest for both.
Our economic partnership covers every area of priority for our two nations.
Singapore is India’s leading destination and source of investments.
Thousands of Indian companies are registered in Singapore.
Sixteen Indian cities have over 240 direct flights every week to Singapore.
I had a very satisfying visit to the Philippines a little over two months ago.
In addition to attending the ASEAN-India, EAS and related Summits, I had the pleasure of meeting President Duterte and we had extensive discussions on how to carry forward our warm and problem-free relationship.
We are both strong in services and our growth rates are amongst the highest among major countries.
Our business and trade potential holds great promise.
I laud President Duterte’s commitment to bringing about inclusive development and to fighting corruption.
These are areas where both countries can work together.
We are happy to share our experience with the Philippines in universal ID cards, financial inclusion, making banking accessible to all, facilitating direct transfer of benefits, and in promoting cashless transactions.
Making affordable medicines available to all is another priority area for the government of the Philippines that we are ready to contribute to.
Bilateral trade between India and Malaysia has increased more than two-fold in 10 years.
India and Malaysia have a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement since 2011.
This Agreement is unique in the sense that both sides have offered ASEAN Plus commitments in trade in goods and have exchanged WTO Plus offers in trade in services.
Bilateral trade between India and Brunei has more than doubled over the last decade.
Vice-President of India visited Brunei in February 2016.
Relations between India and Lao PDR are extensively spread across many areas.
India has been actively involved in power transmission and agricultural sectors in Lao PDR.
Today, India and Lao PDR cooperate in a number of multilateral and regional fora.
We also have immense opportunities in services trade that goes in building the economy of Lao PDR.
Implementation of the ASEAN-India Services and Investment Agreement would help facilitate our services trade.
Separated by a mere 90 nautical miles in the Indian Ocean, India and Indonesia share a continuity of civilizational relationship that spans over two millennia.
‘Unity in Diversity’ or Bhinneka Tunggal Ika is also a key facet of the shared societal value structures that both countries celebrate, as also the common values of democracy and rule of law.
Today, as Strategic Partners, our cooperation spans across the entire gamut of political, economic, defence & security, cultural and people to people fields.
Indonesia continues to be our largest trading partner in ASEAN.
Bilateral trade between India and Indonesia increased 2.5 times in the last ten years.
The traditional and friendly relations between India and Cambodia are deeply rooted in civilizational ties.
The magnificent structure of Angkor Wat temple is a glorious testimony and grand symbol of our ancient historical, religious and cultural links.
India was proud to undertake restoration and preservation of Angkor Wat temple during the difficult period from 1986-1993.
India continues this valuable association in the ongoing restoration of Ta-Prohm temple.
After the collapse of Khmer Rouge regime, India was the first country to recognize the new government in 1981.
India was also associated with the Paris Peace Accord and its finalization in 1991.
These traditional bonds of friendship have strengthened through regular exchange of high level visits.
We have expanded our cooperation in diverse fields such as institutional capacity building, human resource development, developmental and social projects, cultural exchanges, defence cooperation, tourism and people-to- people contact.
In the ASEAN context, and on various global platforms, Cambodia is an important interlocutor and a supportive partner for India.
India is committed to remain a partner in Cambodia’s economic development and looks forward to further deepen its traditional ties.
And, India and ASEAN are doing much more.
Our partnership in ASEAN-led institutions like East Asia Summit, ADMM+ (the ASEAN Defence Ministerial Meeting Plus) and ARF (the ASEAN Regional Forum) are advancing peace and stability in our region.
India is also an eager participant in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, seeking a comprehensive, balanced and fair agreement for all 16 participants.
The strength and resilience of partnerships come not just from arithmetic of numbers, but also from the underpinnings of the relationship.
India and ASEAN nations have relations free from contests and claims.
We have a common vision for the future, built on commitment to inclusion and integration, belief in sovereign equality of all nations irrespective of size, and support for free and open pathways of commerce and engagement.
The ASEAN-India partnership will continue to grow.
With the gift of demography, dynamism and demand — and with rapidly maturing economies — India and ASEAN will build a strong economic partnership.
Connectivity will increase and trade will expand.
In an era of cooperative and competitive federalism in India, our states are also building productive cooperation with Southeast Asian nations.
India’s Northeast is on a resurgent path.
Links with Southeast Asia will accelerate its progress.
In turn, a connected Northeast will be a bridge to ASEAN-India ties of our dreams.
As Prime Minister, I have attended four annual ASEAN-India Summits and East Asia Summit.
These have reinforced my conviction in ASEAN unity, centrality and leadership in shaping the region in this vision.
This is a year of milestones.
India turned 70 last year.
ASEAN reached the golden milestone of 50 years.
We can each look to our future with optimism and to our partnership with confidence.
At 70, India exudes the spirit, enterprise and energy of its young population.
As the fastest growing major economy in the world, India has become the new frontier of global opportunities and an anchor of stability of the global economy.
With every passing day, it is easier and smoother to do business in India.
I hope that ASEAN nations, as our neighbours and friends, will be an integral part of New India’s transformation.
We admire ASEAN’s own progress.
Born when Southeast Asia was a theatre of a brutal war and a region of uncertain nations, ASEAN has united 10 countries behind a common purpose and a shared future.
We have the potential to pursue higher ambitions and address the challenges of our times: from infrastructure and urbanisation to resilient agriculture and a healthy planet.
We can also use the power of digital technology, innovation and connectivity to transform lives at unprecedented speed and scale.
A future of hope needs a solid bedrock of peace.
This is an age of change, disruptions and shifts that comes only rarely in history.
ASEAN and India have immense opportunities — indeed, enormous responsibility — to chart a steady course through the uncertainty and turbulence of our times to a stable and peaceful future for our region and the world.
Indians have always looked East to see the nurturing sunrise and the light of opportunities.
Now, as before, the East, or the Indo-Pacific Region, will be indispensable to India’s future and our common destiny.
The ASEAN-India partnership will play a defining role in both.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today visited the L&T workers’ residential complex in Riyadh.
L&T is part of a consortium that is building a section of the Riyadh Metro.
He said that in future, the Riyadh Metro too would similarly evoke memories about Indian workers who had contributed to its construction.
The Prime Minister said he often gets to know about Indians working abroad through letters he receives from their relatives.

Recall my interactions with her whenever I visited Saputara.
“I bow to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on his Jayanti.
India is proud that a valorous and great soul like him was born on our land.
Shivaji Maharaj placed wellbeing of his people above everything.
He was an ideal ruler blessed with exceptional administrative skills.
Just recently, I had the honour to join the programme for Shivaji Maharaj’s statue off the Arabian Sea.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Opening Ceremony of the International Vesak Day Celebrations at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall in Colombo.
The function began with the recital of the 5 Buddhist precepts.
The welcome speech was delivered by Mr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakse, Sri Lankan Minister for Buddha Sasana and Justice.
“For us in Sri Lanka, you are one of us, he said, addressing Shri Narendra Modi.
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena said it is a matter of great fortune, that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is present here today.
He brings a message of friendship and peace, the President added.
Placed below are some key excerpts from the Prime Minister’s speech:
Bodh Gaya in India, where Prince Siddhartha became the Buddha, is the sacred nucleus of the Buddhist universe.
Lord Buddha’s first sermon in Varanasi, which I have the honour to represent in the Parliament, set in motion the wheel of Dhamma.
Our key national symbols have taken inspiration from Buddhism.
Buddhism and its various strands are deep seated in our governance, culture and philosophy.
The divine fragrance of Buddhism spread from India to all corners of the globe.
Mahindra and Sanghamitra, the worthy children of King Ashoka made their journey from India to Sri Lanka as Dhamma-Doot to spread the biggest gift of Dhamma.
Today, Sri Lanka takes pride in being among the most important centres of Buddhist teachings and learning.
In some way, you took us back to our own roots.
The world also owes a debt of gratitude to Sri Lanka for preserving some of the most important elements of the Buddhist heritage.
Vesak is an occasion for us to celebrate this unbroken shared heritage of Buddhism.
My Tamil brothers and sisters will also be able to visit Varanasi, the land of Kashi Viswanath.
An opportunity to achieve a quantum jump in our partnership across different fields.
And, for us, the most relevant benchmark for the success of our friendship is your progress and success.
We are committed to the economic prosperity of our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters.
We will continue to invest in driving positive change and economic growth to deepen our development cooperation.
Our strength lies in sharing our knowledge, capacity and prosperity.
In trade and investment, we are already significant partners.
We believe that free flow of trade, investments, technology, and ideas across our borders will be to our mutual benefit.
India’s rapid growth can bring dividends for the entire region, especially in Sri Lanka.
In infrastructure and connectivity, transport and energy, we are poised to scale up our cooperation.
Our development partnership stretches across nearly every sector of human activity such as agriculture, education, health, resettlement, transport, power, culture, water, shelter, sports, and human resources.
Today, India’s development cooperation with Sri Lanka amounts to US Dollars 2.6 billion.
And, its only aim is to support Sri Lanka in realizing a peaceful, prosperous and secure future for its people.
Because, the economic and social well being of the people of Sri Lanka is linked with that of 1.25 billion Indians.
Because, whether it is on land or in the waters of the Indian Ocean, the security of our societies is indivisible.
My conversations with President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickramasinghe have only reinforced our will to join hands in achieving our common goals.
As you make important choices for the harmony and progress of your society, you will find in India a friend and partner that will support your nation-building endeavours.
It has been a unifying force among nations.
The countries of South, Central, South East and East Asia are proud of their Buddhist links traced to the land of Buddha.
The themes of Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace, chosen for the Vesak day, resonate deeply with Buddha’s teachings.
The issue of Social justice is linked to conflict within and among communities.
This arises principally because of Tanhaa, or Trishna in Sanskrit, the thirst, which in turn stems from greed.
Greed has driven the mankind to dominate and degrade our natural habitat.
I firmly believe that Buddhism’s message of peace is the answer to growing arc of violence all over the world.
And, not just a notion of peace defined by the absence of conflict.
But, an active peace where we all work to promote dialogue, harmony and justice, based on Karuna (compassion) and Pragya (wisdom).
As Buddha said, “there is no higher bliss than peace”.
Thank you once again for the honour to be with you.

In my speech at the Australian Parliament in 2014 I had spoken of legendary Bradman and Tendulkar.
Today, Virat Kohli in India and Steven Smith in Australia are shaping the young brigades of cricket.
I hope your visit to India is as productive as it has been for Steven Smith’s batting, the other Australian Captain.
I vividly recall our meetings on the sidelines of G-20.
They have always reflected a strong sense of convergence and purpose.
I particularly appreciate your active interest in advancing the substance of our engagement.
The journey of our cooperation is firmly on course.
Under your leadership, our relationship has touched new milestones.
And, your visit gives us an opportunity to shape new priorities in our strategic partnership.
The waters of the Indian Ocean remind us of our linked histories.
They are also a pointer to our connected destinies.
The values and principles of democracy and rule of law are common to both our nations.
Today, the vast scope of opportunities in our ties is defined by a strong desire for economic prosperity by 1.25 billion people of India, and Australia’s capacities and strengths.
In our discussions today, Prime Minister and I reviewed the entire gamut of bilateral relations.
In a lighter vein I am, of course, glad that our decisions are not subject to the D.R.S. review system.
Both India and Australia recognize the central value of education and innovation in the prosperity of our societies.
It is no surprise, therefore, that cooperation in the field of education and research is one of the most important aspects of our engagement.
Our joint development of bananas fortified with Vitamin A has entered the phase of field trials.
Our scientists are also collaborating on developing more nutritious and hardy varieties of pulses.
A number of institution-to-institution tie-ups have been concluded during this visit.
Prime Minister Turnbull and I discussed ways by which Australian Universities could connect and contribute to this goal.
Prime Minister and I share a conviction that our economic growth and prosperity must be gentle on the environment.
We are happy that our dialogue and cooperation in other forms of energy including renewable energy is on the up-swing.
I would also like to thank Prime Minister for Australia’s decision to join the International Solar Alliance.
And, With the passing of legislation in the Australian Parliament with bi-partisan support, Australia is now ready to export Uranium to India.
Prime Minister and I recognize that our future is deeply tied to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.
We, therefore, agree on the need for a secure and rule based Indo-Pacific.
We are also aware that in this globalized world, challenges like terrorism and cyber security, extend beyond the boundaries of our region.
And, therefore, require global strategy and solutions.
Indeed, Prime Minister’s understanding and insight into regional and global issues brings a new dimension to our cooperation on matters that concern us both.
Our bilateral mechanisms on counter-terrorism and trans-national crimes are functioning well.
I am particularly pleased that we have been able to conclude an MOU on Security Cooperation during this visit.
We also agree that strong regional institutions are necessary for peace, prosperity and a sense of balance in our region.
We would, therefore, actively work to cooperate more closely with members of the East Asia Summit and the Indian Ocean Rim countries to pursue our common interests.
A major pillar of strength in our partnership is the connect between our societies.
Australia is also home to nearly half-a-million people of Indian origin.
Their prosperity and vibrant culture enrich our partnership.
A very successful Festival of India called “Confluence” was held in many cities of Australia last year.
I thank Prime Minister for all the help and support accorded to the Festival by the Australian Government.
India and Australia have made major strides in our bilateral relations in recent years.
In months and years ahead, we only see promise and opportunities for our two nations.
Our strong and vibrant strategic partnership is of course important for the security and well-being of our societies.
But, it is also a major factor for peace, stability and security in our region.
Thank you very much.
This journey has reached its 50th episode today.
Your letters and phone calls this time pertain mostly to these 50 episodes.
Anshu Kumar & Amar Kumar from Delhi on Mygov, Vikas Yadav from Patna; on similar lines Monica Jain from Delhi, Prosenjit Sarkar from Bardhaman, West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri from Nagpur converge in asking a shared question.
They are of the view that broadly speaking, their Prime Minister being associated with the latest in technology, Social Media and Mobile Apps; WHY did he choose radio as a medium to connect with his countrymen?
Your curiosity is but natural; in this age when Radio was fading into oblivion, why did Modi opt for the airwaves?
It was the month of May; and I was travelling to a certain place.
Evenings tend to get cold in the hilly terrain of Himachal Pradesh, and I stopped by at a wayside tea stall and placed an order for tea.
Said he “Sir, just listen to the radio”.
Indeed, that exactly was the topic of discussion on the radio.
It was then that he elaborated on how on the day of the nuclear test, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had announced to the Media and how he broke into a dance on listening to it on the radio.
I have been nursing that feeling ever since, acknowledging its power & strength.
Hence when I became the Prime Minister, it was natural for me to turn towards a strong, effective medium.
And in 2014, when I took charge as the Pradhan Sevak, Principal Servant, it was my wish to reach out to the masses with the glorious saga of our country’s unity, her grand history, her valour, India’s diversity, our cultural diversity, virtues embedded in our society such as Purusharth, Tapasya, Passion & sacrifice; in a nutshell, the great story of India.
From remote villages to Metro cities, from farmers to young professionals … the array just prompted me to embark upon this journey of ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
Every month, we would read letters to the tune of lakhs, listen to phone calls, watch comments on the App & Mygov.
Weaving a common thread comprising them all into a fabric of informal conversation, we have been able to travel together, over this rather long distance of 50 episodes.
Recently, All India Radio got a survey done on ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
I came across some feedback that is very interesting.
Out of the designated sample in the survey, 70% of respondents on an average happen to be listeners who regularly tune in to ‘’Mann Ki Baat’.
Most people believe that the greatest contribution of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has been the enhancement of a feeling of positivity in our society.
This is an exemplary glimpse of the feeling of positivity, innate to our countrymen.
People have shared their experiences, conveying the rise of selfless volunteerism as a consequence of ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
Your apprehension is not misplaced.
The fact is, if a leader gets hold of a microphone with assured listeners to the tune of millions, what else does he need?
Significantly, some young friends have attempted a study on the myriad subjects touched upon, over the many episodes of ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
One of their findings was that, this programme has remained apolitical.
The greatest bulwark in ensuring adherence to my resolve; in fact my highest inspiration, have been you.
As a run up to each episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, the expectations & aspirations of listeners through their letters, online comments & phone calls are crystal clear.
These minute stories encompassing a 130 crore countrymen will always stay alive.
This new inspiration & zest will keep taking her to greater heights.
At times, when I look back, I am taken aback.
The stories that you’ve sent across in the context of cleanliness, myriad examples of common folk… you never know where a tiny brand ambassador of cleanliness comes into being in various homes; someone who reprimands elders at home; or even admonishingly orders the Prime Minister through a phone call!
Who would have imagined that a small campaign “selfie with daughter”starting from a small village in Haryana would spread not only throughout the country but also across other countries as well.
Their heartsand my heart beat to the same rhythm.
Mann Ki Baat is not about the Government it is about the society.
Mann Ki Baat addresses an aspirational India, an ambitious India.
In fact, Politics is one of the numerous other aspects of social life.
Making politics an all pervasive, powerful factor is not an effective way for a healthy society.
At times, political developments and political people assume such overriding prominence that other talents and courageous deeds get overshadowed.
Manythanks for your phone call.
In a way your question were the a personal,amiable touch.
Actually, Mann Ki Baat is a very simpletask for me.
My effort is that I read the maximum number of these letters and comments myself before Mann Ki Baat.
I listen to many phone calls too.
Andas the episode of Mann Ki Baat draws closer, I read ideas and inputs sent by you very minutely while travelling.
Then, I note down facts like the name of the village and of the person.
I firmly believe that your ideas and your views will continue reaching me in even greater numbers and will help make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, effective and useful.
An effort is also made that the concerned department should pay attention to such letters and comments which, somehow, could not be included in Mann Ki Baat.
I also thank my colleagues from All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV Channels and the Social Media.
It is due to their hard work that Mann Ki Baat reaches maximum number of people.
The team from All India Radio prepares each episode for broadcast in a number of regional languages.
I congratulate and thank those persons for their talent and skills.
I would request all of you also to kindly listen to this programme in your regional language as well.
I sincerely thank from the core of my heart my friends in the media who regularly telecast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
No political person is ever happy with the media, he feels that he is getting a very little coverage or the coverage given to him is negative.But many issues raised in Mann Ki Baat have been adopted by the media.
Issues such as cleanliness, Road safety, drugs free India, selfie with daughter have been taken up by the media and turn into campaigns.
To tell you the truth, I have no such secret.
What I am doing must be happening in families as well.
In simple words, I may say that I try to cast myself into the mould of that young man, and put myself under his conditions and try to adjust and match the wave length accordingly.
There are old baggage’s of our own lives and when they do not come in the way, it becomes easier to understand others.
Sometimes our inhibitions or prejudices become a big hurdle in communication.
I prefer to understand the other man’s point of view rather than going through the process of acceptance, rejection and reaction.
None of the two even realizes that how and when one other’s has abandoned its idea and accepted and owned the idea of the other side.
Today’s youths have this special quality that they won’t do anything which they do not believe themselves and whenever they believe in something, they follow that leaving everything else.
People generally talk of a communication gap between the elders and teenagers in the family.
In fact, the scope of discussion with teenagers is quite limited in most of the families.
Most of the time these talks remain limited to studies, habits or life style and the “do’s” and “don’ts”.
An open discussion without any expectations is gradually on the decline and this too is a matter of concern.
Communication will be more effective if we “accept” instead of “expect” and “discuss” instead of “dismiss”.
My effort is to have a continuous dialogue with the youth in various programmes or through social media.
I try to learn from whatever they are doing or whatever they are thinking.
They are storehouse of ideas.
They are extremely energetic, innovative and focused.
I try to share the efforts and achievements of the youth as much as possible through “Mann Ki Baat”.
There is a general complaint that the younger generation asks too many questions.
I say it is good that the youth ask questions.
We feel that the youths are very ambitious today and they plan big.
I feel it is good, dream big and achieve bigger successes; after all, this is “the New India”.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to accomplish a many things at a time.
I say what is wrong in it.
They do so because they are adept in multitasking.
If we just look around, we find that it is the youth who are bringing in transformation of society in a big way, may it be social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports or any other field.
Those youth who have dared to ask questions and have had the courage to dream big.
My dear countrymen, Vineeta ji from Gurugram- has posted on MyGov that in Mann Ki Baat I should talk about the “Constitution Day” which falls on the26th November.
She says that this day is special because we are going to enter into the 70th year of our Constitution adoption.
Thank you very much for your suggestion Vineeta ji.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
A day to remember those great personalities who drafted our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
The Constituent Assembly took 2 years 11 months and 17 days to accomplish this stupendous task of drafting the Constitution.
Just imagine, these luminaries gave us such a comprehensive and detailed Constitution within a period of just less than 3 years.
The extraordinary pace at which they drafted the Constitution is an example of Time Management and productivity to emulate even today.
This also inspires us to accomplish our responsibilities within a record time.
The unique point in our Constitution is that the rights and duties have been very comprehensively detailed.
A balance between these two in the lives of our citizens will take our nation forward.
I still remember that in 2010 when 60 years of the adoption of the Constitution were being celebrated, we had taken out a procession by placing our Constitution atop an elephant.
This has been a memorable incident to increase awareness about our Constitution among the youth and to connect them to the various aspects of the Constitution.
In the year 2020, we shall complete 70 years as a Republic and in 2022, we shall enter 75th year of our Independence.
Let us all take forward the values enshrined in our Constitution and ensure Peace, Progress and Prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, the contribution of that great man cannot be forgotten who played a pivotal role in the Constituent Assembly.
This great man was none other than our revered Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His death anniversary or mahaparirvan divas falls on 6th December.
I, on behalf of all countrymen, pay my homage to Baba Saheb who gave the right to live with dignity to crores of Indians.
Democracy was embedded deep in Baba Saheb’s nature and he used to say that India’s democratic values have not been imported from outside.
What is a republic and what is a parliamentary system- are nothing new to India.
He had made a very moving appeal in the Constituent Assembly that we have to safeguard our hard fought democracy till the last drop of our blood.
He also used to say that we, Indians may be from different background but, yes, we shall have to keep the national interest above all the other things.
“India First” was the basic doctrine of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Once again my humble tribute to revered Baba Saheb.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji always envisaged the welfare of entire humanity.
He always showed the path of truth, work, service, kindness and amity to the society.
All states and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate the occasion in a grand manner.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated in a similar manner in all the countries of the world as well.
Besides, a train will be run on a route joining all the holy places connected with Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Recently, while holding a meeting in this regard I remembered about of Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
But our journey shall continue.
The more you connect with us, our journey will gain greater depth, providing, satisfaction to one and all.
At times a question arises in the minds of people’s as to what I achieved through Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to say today that of the feedback of this programme, one of the points that touches my heart most- is when people tell me that when we sit with all our family members to listen to Mann Ki Baat, we feel that the head of our family is sitting with us and sharing his ideas with us.
Come on, let us take this journey further.

Terrorism remains one of the greatest challenges to global peace and security.
Today, the financial, logistical and information networks of terror span the entire globe.
The barriers of geography do not safeguard against the threat of radicalization and terrorism.
Nations who believe in humanity need to coordinate their actions and policies to counter this threat.
Prime Minister Key and I have agreed to strengthen our security and intelligence cooperation against terrorism and radicalization, including in the domain of cyber security.
The people of New Zealand have expressed their confidence in your leadership time and again and, I can see why.
I thank you, Excellency, for your personal commitment to take our bilateral partnership forward, and to strengthen the bonds of friendship and people to people relations between our countries.
Thank you very much.

The person in the Royal Palace in London is the Sevak of 125 crore Indians
My life at the Railway Station taught me so much.
It was about my personal struggles.
When you said Royal Palace, it is not about me but about the 125 crore people of India
‘Besabri’ is not a bad thing.
If a person has a cycle, a person aspires a scooter.
If a person has a scooter, a person aspires a car.
It is nature to aspire.
India is getting increasingly aspirational
I was not born with an aim to be in history books.
I request you all- remember our country and not Modi.
I am just like you all, a common citizen of India
Look back at India’s history.
India has never desired anyone else’s territory.
During World War 1 and 2 we had no stake but our soldiers took part in the Wars.
These were big sacrifices.
Look at our role in UN Peacekeeping Forces
We believe in peace.
But we will not tolerate those who like to export terror.
We will give back strong answers and in the language they understand.
Terrorism will never be accepted
I want to work for the poor, the marginalised and the downtrodden.
One of the things I wanted to do in London was to pay homage to Bhagwan Basaveshwara
The 125 crore people of India are my family
What prevented Indian Prime Ministers from going to Israel.
Yes, I will go to Israel and I will even go to Palestine.
I will further cooperation with Saudi Arabia and for the energy needs of India I will also engage with Iran
Democracy cannot succeed without constructive criticism.
My problem is not against criticism.
To criticise, one has to research and find proper facts.
Sadly, it does not happen now.
What happens instead is allegations
I request you all- remember our country and not Modi.
I am just like you all, a common citizen of India.

He described the University and its students as pioneers.
He said that these traits of self-belief and determination will help the students in times to come.
The Prime Minister said that a strong forensic science setup, helps in ensuring civic safety, and curbing crime, much the same way as an efficient police force and an effective judiciary.
The Prime Minister said that it is important for a person to fear the possibility that he is very likely to be caught, if he commits a crime.
This is where forensic science becomes important, the Prime Minister said.
He complimented GFSU for creating an international human resource pool in the fields of criminal investigation and justice delivery.
He said the Gujarat Forensic Sciences University is playing a decisive role in global security, through its training and education.

It is a great honour to commission the Barracuda today in the service of the National Coast Guard of Mauritius.
Thank you for giving me this privilege.
Thank you for choosing India as your partner.
This ship has made a long journey – from Kolkata across the great arc of Indian Ocean to this beautiful shore.
Generations ago, people from India charted that course to a new destination and a new life.
Today, Barracuda brings with her the goodwill and greetings of the people of India.
She represents our unique trust and confidence.
She reflects our partnership that has stood the test of time.
She is a symbol of our shared commitment to peace and security in Indian Ocean- our common maritime home.
Barracuda is a beautiful ship.
She is also very capable; and built to specifications of Mauritius.
Now, she sails proudly with the flag of Mauritius.
She will protect your islands and your waters.
She will be there to help in times of distress and emergencies.
But, she will do more than that.
She will also help make our Indian Ocean safer and more secure.
This Ocean bears two-thirds of the world`s oil shipments, one-third of its bulk cargo; and half of its container traffic.
Over three-fourths of its traffic goes to other regions of the world.
It touches Australia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia and the eastern seaboard of Africa.
It sparkles with the gems of island states.
Consider the vast opportunities that it holds!
Today, the world speaks of 21st century driven by the dynamism and the energy of Asia and the Pacific.
But, its course will be determined by the tides of the Indian Ocean.
This is why Indian Ocean is at the centre of global attention more than ever before.
We also see growing global stakes and presence in the Ocean.
Even in this changing world, the oceans hold the key to its fortunes.
And, we will all prosper when the seas are safe, secure and free for all.
To ensure this will be our greatest collective responsibility.
But, we will also have to rise to other challenges that are not uncommon in our region.
We have seen the tragedy of tsumanis and cyclones.
Illegal fishing and oil spills hurt our economies.
We all feel the rising impact of climate change on our coasts and islands.
We have also seen that instability and turmoil in coastal and island states can have profound impact on security on the seas.
India is at the crossroads of Indian Ocean.
Our cultural footprints stretch across Asia and Africa.
We see this in our strong Diaspora across oceans.
The seas forged links of commerce, culture, and religion with our extended neighbourhood across several millenniums.
Our more recent history has focused our attention on our continental neighborhood.
But, India has been shaped in more ways by the seas around us.
Today, 90% of our trade by volume and 90% of our oil imports take place through sea.
India is becoming more integrated globally.
We will be more dependent than before on the ocean and the surrounding regions.
We must also assume our responsibility to shape its future.
So, Indian Ocean Region is at the top of our policy priorities.
It means many things.
One, we will do everything to safeguard our mainland and islands and defend our interests.
Equally we will work to ensure a safe, secure and stable Indian Ocean Region that delivers us all to the shores of prosperity.
And, our capabilities will be there for those struck by the ocean`s fury.
Or, caught in distress on the seas.
We will also continue to build their maritime security capacities and their economic strength.
Three, collective action and cooperation will best advance peace and security in our maritime region.
It will also prepare us better to respond to emergencies.
That is why, in 2008, India promoted the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium.
Today, it brings together 35 navies of the region.
Four, we also seek a more integrated and cooperative future in the region that enhances the prospects for sustainable development for all.
To me the blue chakra or wheel in India`s national flag represents the potential of Blue Revolution or the Ocean Economy.
Our Indian Ocean Rim Association can be an important instrument for pursuing our vision for a sustainable and prosperous future in the region.
We often define regional groupings around landmass.
The time has come for a strong grouping around the Indian Ocean.
We will pursue this with new vigour in the years ahead.
We will strive to unite our region in partnership, as we were once in geography.
An Ocean that connects our world should become the pathway of peace and prosperity for all.
It is no coincidence that I speak of our hopes for the Indian Ocean Region in Mauritius.
Our partnership with Mauritius is among our strongest maritime relationships in this world.
Our partnership will grow.
We will together build our capabilities.
We will also train and patrol the seas together.
But, the foundation of this partnership is larger.
It is our shared values and a common vision.
It is our willingness to look beyond our own domain to assume our responsibility for the region.
Mauritius is a key leader for a secure and sustainable future for the Indian Ocean.
We in India are proud to be your partner.

He recalled how on Netaji’s call, many youths from the Andaman had dedicated themselves to the freedom of India.
The flag on the 150 feet high mast, is an attempt to preserve the memory of the day in 1943, when Netaji unfurled the tricolour.
As a mark of respect to Netaji, Ross Island had been named as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Dweep.
Earlier in October 2015, family members of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had met PM and requested for declassification of the files relating to Netaji, available with the Government of India.
Digital copies of 100 Netaji Files were released by the PM in January 2018 in public domain at National Archives of India.

I deeply appreciate your gesture of hosting me in the midst of ASEAN and East Asia Summits.

It has been an honour and privilege to welcome President Xi, President Zuma President Temer, and President Putin to the beautiful state of Goa.
Our discussions, that spread over three sessions today, were detailed, substantive and productive.
In the morning, we exchanged views on important global issues, including terrorism, global economic scenario, and the need to reform the global governance architecture.
We also utilized the opportunity to review on-going BRICS cooperation.
During the Plenary Session, we focused on ideas and possibilities for BRICS future expansion in years ahead.
The conversation was useful and forward looking.
And, as we mark a decade of BRICS, it is particularly timely.
We have just ended a session with the BRICS Business Council.
We also heard from the President of the New Development Bank on the meaningful work that NDB has undertaken in its first year.
I am happy to share that we have adopted the Goa Declaration that lays down a comprehensive vision for our cooperation and coordination, within BRICS and on international issues.
Let me now turn to the issues that received high attention from the BRICS Leaders during the Summit.
But, also to our society, our way of life and humanity as a whole.
We were also one in agreeing that BRICS need to work together and act decisively to combat this threat.
We also agreed that those who nurture, shelter, support and sponsor such forces of violence and terror are as much a threat to us as the terrorists themselves.
India is happy to note the unity of thought and purpose on this serious global challenge.
Putting the global economy back on track was another focus point of our deliberations.
We recognized the positive contribution of BRICS countries’ to global economic growth after the 2008 financial crisis.
We feel that it is necessary for economies to make public investments in long term infrastructure projects, coordinate macro-economic policy, drive growth, and promote world trade and manufacturing with renewed vigour.
We emphasized the central role for the WTO as the cornerstone of the multilateral trade architecture.
We acknowledged the need to strike a balance between economic development and environmental protection.
We welcome the early entry into force of the Paris Climate Agreement.
We commended the New Development Bank on completion of its first year.
We agreed that the NDB should continue to focus on infrastructure, technology and renewable energy sectors.
We were united in our view to establish the BRICS Agriculture Research Platform, BRICS Railway Research Network, BRICS Sports Council, and various youth-centric fora.
We spoke in one voice of our resolve to promote the reform of the global financial and economic architecture, and expand the role of emerging and developing economies in the International Monetary Fund.
In order to further bridge the gap in the global financial architecture, we agreed to fast track the setting up of a BRICS Rating Agency.
We also agreed to enhance our coordination within the G20.
The vitality of people-to-people contacts amongst the BRICS countries has been a point of emphasis for us.
We have agreed to nurture people-to-people pillar of our cooperation as a continuing effort.
The BRICS is also committed to strengthen our consultations and cooperation on peace and security matters.
A highlight of the Goa Summit will be the outreach to the BIMSTEC countries.
The first BRICS-BIMSTEC Outreach Summit will be held later today.
This will be a unique opportunity for BRICS and BIMSTEC leaders to hold a conversation on prospects for closer partnership and coordination.
As home to nearly two third of humanity, BRICS and BIMSTEC together can potentially unlock immense synergies with huge benefits for all our people.
In conclusion, I would like to thank my fellow leaders from the BRICS countries for their unqualified support in ensuring a successful 8th BRICS Summit.

Today, Excellency Sheikh Hasina and I held productive and comprehnsive discussions on the full range of our partnership.
We agreed that the agenda of our cooperation has to remain focused on purposeful action.
We specifically looked at charting new avenues and tapping fresh opportunities in advancing our relationship.
These would include working in the fields of Electronics, Information Technology, Cyber Security, Space exploration, Civil Nuclear Energy, and others areas.
India and Bangladesh are also determined that the fruits of our cooperation must benefit our people.
In this context, I am happy to announce a new concessional Line of Credit of 4.5 billion dollars for the implemntation of projects in priority sectors for Bangladesh.
This brings our resource allocation for Bangladesh to more than 8 billion dollars over the past six years.
Energy Security is an important dimension of our development partnership.
And, our energy partnerhship continues to grow.
Today, we added an additional 60 Mega Watt of power to the 600 Mega Watt of power already flowing from India to Bangladesh.
Our companies are entering into a long-term agreement for the supply of high speed diesel to Bangladesh.
We have also agreed on a time table for regular supply till the pipeline is constructed.

Several agreements for investments in the energy sector in Bangladesh are expected to be signed by the Indian companies in the coming days.
India will continue to be a willing partner in meeting the energy needs of Bangladesh, and its goal of achieving ‘Power for all by 2021’.
Connectivity is crucial for the success of bilateral development partnership, sub-regional economic projects and for the larger regional economic prosperity.

The footprint of intra-BRICS engagement has expanded over time to include large areas of economic activity.
The scope of our partnership today stretches from agriculture to industry and innovation; trade to tourism; environment to energy; films to football; skill development to smart cities; and from fighting corruption and money laundering to securing our societies.
This year, we have taken BRICS to our cities and provinces and linked it directly to our people from different walks of life.
We are celebrating 10 years of our partnership under BRICS.
A decade of collaboration has produced strong benefits of cooperation.
We are entitled to take pride in our initiatives and achievements.
The establishment of New Development Bank and the Contingency Reserve Arrangement are indeed signature achievements.
In a world of new security challenges and continuing economic uncertainties, BRICS stands as a beacon of peace potential and promise.
Our work holds much meaning for the developing world.
In the past year, BRICS have played an active role in shaping the global agenda for change and development.
Our association with Agenda 2030, the Paris Climate Agreement, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development has been purposeful and productive.
And, we remain at the forefront of pushing change in the global governance architectures.
We also need to add more content to it.
Let me offer some thoughts for your consideration.
First, the process of institution building in BRICS must continue to remain a focus area.
The institutions that we build must support the development of our countries and regions.
They should enable greater flexibility and freedom, and offer wider choices in responding to our developmental priorities.
We look forward to translating into reality the idea of a BRICS Credit Rating Agency.
We must also speed up the work on setting up BRICS Agriculture Research Centre, BRICS Railway Research Network, and BRICS Sports Council.
There is also a clear need to build norms, create structures and pool our capacities to stop tax evasion, and fight against black money and corruption.
Our agencies must also build mechanisms of information sharing to bring to justice the tax offenders and money launderers.
BRICS should push for empowering the global governance institutions to reflect today’s reality.
Second, transform the quantum and quality of trade and investment linkages among BRICS.
In 2015, intra-BRICS trade stood at about 250 billion US Dollars.
We should set ourselves a target to double this number to US Dollars five hundred billion by 2020.
This requires businesses and industry in all five countries to scale up their engagement.
And, for governments to facilitate this process to the fullest.
Our agreement on a tax and custom cooperation framework is a good start.
The BRICS Trade Fair and Exhibition just concluded in New Delhi should become a regular platform for business exchanges.
And, the BRICS New Development Bank must play an active role to support this objective.
It can also help integrate our SMEs into global value chains.
We must also coordinate closely to preserve the central role of the Doha Development Round and the WTO.
Alongside, we should increase our cooperation and convergence at the G-20, WTO and other fora.
India has tabled a draft of the Trade Facilitation Agreement for Services at the WTO.
It seeks to maximize the benefits of services liberalization and trade to the developing countries.
A strong BRICS support to this proposal will be in our collective economic interest.
Third, focus on key priorities of our economic transformations.
Urbanization, infrastructure and innovation represent the key focus areas for BRICS economies.
Under India’s Chairmanship, we have placed emphasis on digital- technology, smart-cities, urbanization, and cooperation between our cities.
The next billion internet users will come from emerging markets.
Our cooperation must grab this opportunity to transform the basic structure of our economies.
Fourth, secure our societies.
Terrorist funding, their weapons supply, training and political support must be systematically cut off.
In this respect, we need to deepen the security cooperation between our National Security Advisors.
Early adoption of the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism will be an expression of our resolve to fight this menace.
Fifth, thriving people-to-people exchanges is the lifeblood of BRICS.
It brings vibrancy and richness to our partnership.
We have chosen to highlight this dimension this year.
The BRICS Films Festival, Trade Fair, Tourism Convention, Sports Council, Football Tournament and other related activities will help in creating millions of young stakeholders that will ultimately carry our partnership forward.
I am eager to hear from my fellow BRICS leaders on their vision for a stronger, deeper and vibrant BRICS community.
I thank you for your attention.

Our strategic partnership with ASEAN is also important for safeguarding and promoting our security interests and countering traditional and non-traditional security challenges in the region.
East Asia Summit is the premier forum for discussions on the challenges and opportunities before the Asia Pacific region.
Our ties with the countries of South East Asia are truly historic.
Our engagement and approach can be best encapsulated in just one word – connectivity.
Let me begin by sincerely thanking President Xi again for his warm reception and the excellent organisation of this Summit.
Our interaction during the restricted session was constructive.
It enriched our mutual understanding and perspectives.
At the same time, our Central Banks have taken steps to make the Contingent Reserve Arrangement fully operational.
These are milestones of progress we can build upon.
Looking ahead, it is important that our people remain at the centre of our journey.
I am happy to note that China has taken forward the people-to-people thrust of our exchanges from last year.
Such inter-mingling will consolidate our links and deepen our understanding.
India’s own far-reaching journey of transformation gives pride of place to our people.
We are in mission-mode to eradicate poverty; to ensure health, sanitation, skills, food security, gender equality, energy, education and innovation.
Moving forward, using the springboard of our national experiences, BRICS countries can deepen partnership for win-win results.
Some thoughts come to mind for upgrading mutual cooperation.
First, last year we discussed pooling our efforts to create a BRICS rating agency.
Second, our Central Banks must further strengthen their capabilities and promote co-operation between the Contingent Reserve Arrangement and the IMF.
Third, affordable, reliable, and sustainable access to energy is crucial for the development of our nations.
Climate resilient development calls upon us to utilise all available resource streams.
Renewable energy is particularly important on multiple counts.
Recognizing this, India, together with France, launched a major international initiative – the International Solar Alliance (ISA) – in November 2015.
It will bring together a coalition of 121 countries for mutual gains through enhanced solar energy utilisation.
BRICS countries can work closely with ISA to strengthen the solar energy agenda.
Our five countries have complementary skills and strengths to promote use of renewable and solar energy.
The NDB can also establish an effective link with ISA to support such cooperation.
We would wish to see more clean energy funding, particularly in solar energy, from the NDB.
Fourth, we are nations with large youth populations.
We need to mainstream our youth in our joint initiatives as far as possible.
Scaled up cooperation in skill development and exchange of best practices will be a valuable instrument.
Fifth, at the Goa Summit last year we had exchanged thoughts on smart-cities, urbanization, and disaster-management in the context of cooperation between our cities.
We need to further accelerate this track.
Sixth, Technology and innovation are the foundations of the next generation of global growth and transformation.
India has also found that technology and digital resources are powerful tools in fighting poverty and corruption.
A strong BRICS partnership on innovation and digital economy can help spur growth, promote transparency and support the Sustainable Development Goals.
I would suggest considering a collaborative pilot project under the BRICS framework, including private entrepreneurship.
BRICS leadership will be crucial in driving this transformation.
If we as BRICS can set the agenda in these areas, the world will call this its Golden Decade.
In our outreach segment with emerging markets tomorrow.

I am delighted to welcome President Almazbek Atambayev on his first state visit to India.
Excellency, the warmth of your hospitality and welcome during my visit to the Kyrgyz Republic in July last year is still fresh in my mind.
Your visit this time helps us to carry forward the momentum of our cooperation and high level contacts.
The relationship between India and the Kyrgyz Republic is filled with goodwill from centuries of shared historical links.
Our societies share a sense of warmth that permeates our contacts with Central Asia, including the Kyrgyz Republic.
We are also bound by a common belief in democratic values and traditions.
Much credit goes to President Atambaev for nurturing and building strong foundations of democracy in Kyrgyz Republic.
President Atambayev and I held extensive discussions on the full range of our bilateral engagement.
We focused on our common priority of diversifying and deepening bilateral engagement.
We also discussed how we could work together to secure our youth and society against the common challenges of terrorism, extremism, and radicalism.
We agreed on the need to coordinate and work closely in addressing and overcoming these challenges for our common benefit.
We regard Kyrgyz Republic as a valuable partner in our common pursuit of making Central Asia a region of sustainable peace, stability and prosperity.
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization will also give us a valuable framework to work together on these issues.
President Atambayev and I reviewed our cooperative engagement in the defence field.
The Kyrgyz-India Mountain Bio-Medical Research Center is an excellent example of successful collaboration.
It has proved to be a rewarding research initiative, which we need to build on.
We have commenced work on a Kyrgyz-India Joint Military Training Center in Kyrgyz Republic.
Our joint military exercises on counter-terrorism are now an annual feature.
The next edition has been planned for first quarter of next year in Kyrgyz Republic.
President Atambayev and I agreed on the need to connect our economies more deeply.
To this end, we will work to strengthen bilateral trade and economic linkages, and facilitate greater people-to-people exchanges.
The understandings concluded today will support our thrust in these directions.
In a first with the Central Asian region, we had initiated tele-medicine links with Kyrgyz Republic last year.
We are taking steps to expand this project to other regions of the Kyrgyz Republic.
India and the Kyrgyz Republic will be marking the 25th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in March 2017.
As we approach this milestone, President Atambayev’s visit to India will drive the process and our efforts of deepening our partnership.
It will also help consolidate the recent gains in our engagement and reinforce our ties in the months and years ahead.
The focus of the budget is on issues ranging from agriculture to Infrastructure.
It is farmer friendly, common man friendly, business environment friendly as well as development friendly.
Ease of Doing Business as well as Ease of Living are in focus in this budget.
More savings for the middle class, new generation infrastructure for 21st Century India and assurance of better health – all these are concrete steps towards Ease of Living.
Our farmers have contributed in a big way towards the progress of the country with a record production of fruits and vegetables.
Several steps have been proposed in this budget to support the farmers and enhance their income.
A record allocation of Rs. 14.5 lakh crores has been made for rural development and agriculture.
Dalits, oppressed and disadvantaged sections of the society will benefit from building of 51 Lakh new homes, more than 3 lakh kilometers roads, about 2 crore toilets, and 1.75 crore electricity connections to households.
These initiatives will create new opportunities especially in the rural areas.
I appreciate the decision to provide for one and a half times remunerative price for the cost incurred by the farmers for their produce.
Center will put in place a sound system in consultation with the states to ensure that the farmers can avail the full benefits from this decision.
‘Operation Greens’ will prove to be an effective instrument in this direction especially for the farmers engaged in producing vegetables and fruits.
In our country, the cooperative societies are exempted from paying income tax.
But the ‘Farmer Producer Organization’ -FPO, that is similar to the cooperative societies, does not get this benefit.
Some are associated with pisciculture, animal husbandry, poultry or bee-keeping.
Farmers used to face difficulties in accessing loans from banks for such additional activities.
But now with Kisan card Arranging loan for pisciculture and animal husbandry has become very effective.
There are about 7000 blocks in more than 700 districts of India.
In these blocks, emphasis has been laid on modernization of infrastructure of 22 thousand rural business centers, by innovative and increased connectivity in the villages.
Under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojna, now the villages will be connected to rural haats (markets), higher education centers and hospitals.
It will make life easier for the people in these villages.
We have seen an extension of the spirit of the Ease of Living in Ujjwala Yojana.
The scheme has not only provided relief to the poor women from the smoke but has also become a huge source of their empowerment.
I am happy to note that the target for Ujjawala has been enhanced from 5 crore families to 6 crore families.
A large number of dalit, tribal and backward class families have been benefited from this scheme.
This budget provides for allocation of about Rs 1 lakh crore for the welfare of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.
Medical treatment and its cost has always been a cause of concern for the lower middle class and poor sections of the society.
The new scheme ‘Ayushman Bharat’, presented in the budget, will address this serious concern.
The scheme will be available to nearly 10 crore poor and lower middle class families of the country.
It means it will provide coverage to 45-50 crore people.
Under the scheme these families will get free treatment up to Rs. 5 lakhs per annum in the identified hospitals.
This is by far, the world’s largest health insurance plan for which government will bear the cost.
The idea of setting up 1.5lakh Health Wellness Centers spread over all the major panchayats of the country is commendable.
This will provide easy access to health care services to the people living in the villages.
Establishment of 24 new medical colleges across the country will not only facilitate the treatment of the people but also help to impart medical education to the youngsters.
It is our endeavor to have at least one medical college for covering three parliamentary constituencies across the country.
Several important decisions have been taken in this budget keeping in mind the concerns 0f Senior Citizens.
Now Senior Citizens will be entitled to have a minimum interest of 8% on amount up to Rs 15 lakh under the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandan Yojana.
No tax will be levied on interest up to Rs 50,000 on their Bank and Post Office deposits.
Health insurance premium worth Rs 50,000 will be exempt from the Income tax.
Besides, relief from Income Tax has been provided on expenditure up to Rs 1 lakh incurred on treatment of serious diseases.
For a long time, the small and medium enterprises or the MSME in our country had to pay higher taxes than the big industries.
A bold step has been taken in this budget wherein the government has reduced the tax rate for MSME by 5%.
They will now have to pay only 25% tax in place of 30% which was the practice earlier.
Credit seeking facility from the banks and NBFCs has been eased to ensure the required working capital for MSME industries.
It will give a further impetus to the mission of Make in India.
In order to promote employment and to provide social security to employees the government has taken a far reaching decision.
This will give a push to shift from informal to formal sector and will generate new job opportunities.
Now the government will contribute 12% in EPF Account of new laborers for a period of 3 years.
Besides, the contribution from new women employees in the EPF for a period of 3 years is being reduced from the existing 12% to 8% so that their take home salary increases and more employment opportunities are available for women.
However, the employer contribution will be maintained at 12%.
This is a major step towards empowerment of working women.
In order to realize the dream of modern India, to enhance Ease of Living of the common man and to ensure stability in development, India requires Next Generation Infrastructure.
Special emphasis has been given to development of infrastructure related to Digital India.
These schemes will enhance employment opportunities in our country manifold.
I congratulate the Finance Minister for tax concession to the salaried and middle class.
This budget will live up to the expectation of every Indian Citizen.
The agreement aims to establish the basis for a cooperative institutional relationship to encourage and promote technical bilateral cooperation on new and renewable issues on the basis of mutual benefit equality and reciprocity.

During the launch of ‘Ek Bharat Shresht Bharat’on 31st October 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said “Sardar Patel gave us Ek Bharat.
It is now the solemn duty of 125 crore Indians to collectively make Shreshta Bharat”.
Narendra Modi believes in honouring national heroes, those who have sacrificed a lot for the unity, security, sovereignty and development of our beloved nation.
He wantsour history and heritage to be part of our national pride and consciousness.
The National Salt Satyagraha Memorial at Dandi, is one example.
It honours the spirit and the energy of the 1930 Dandi March led by Mahatma Gandhi and 80 of his fellow Satyagrahis.
The 182 metre tall Statue of Unity, depicting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is the most vivid example of this.
What is today, the tallest statue in the world, was first envisioned by Narendra Modi while he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.
For decades, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s family demanded that files relating to events in his life be declassified.
Successive Governments refused to take a firm decision.
Until October 2015, when Narendra Modi hosted Netaji’s extended family at his residence.
“I see no reason to strangle history,” he said, adding that those who forget history, also lose the power to create it.
The files were swiftly declassified, and put on a digital platform.
In the mid 1940s, the INA trials at Red Fort, had stirred the nation.
However, for decades, the building in which the trials happened, lay forgotten inside the Red Fort Complex.
On Subhas Bose’s Jayanti this year, the Prime Minister inaugurated a museum in the same building, dedicated to Netaji, and the Indian National Army.
Museums dedicated to the 1857 War of Independence and the JallianwalaBagh massacre also form part of the complex.
Narendra Modi has also announced an awardin the name of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, to honour police personnel involved in disaster response operations.
In the last four years, several other memorials have been made to recall the contributions of many great leaders of our history.
While he was Chief Minister of Gujarat, he had inaugurated the memorial dedicated to Shyamji Krishna Varma in Kutch.

He has laid the Foundation Stone for the Shivaji memorial just off the coast of Mumbai, in the Arabian Sea.
In Delhi, the Prime Minister has inaugurated the Sardar Patel Gallery at the National Science Centre.
Recently, he dedicated the National Police Memorial to the nation, to salute the courage and sacrifice of over 33,000 police personnel who laid down their lives for the service of the nation.
Memorials are reminders of sacrifices, of those whose contributions now enable us to live a better life.
They are a sourceof inspiration for the present and future generations.

GoI’s various initiatives seek to facilitate economic empowerment, self-reliance & social equality as far as Nari Shakti is concerned.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Just a couple of days ago, we celebrated our Republic Day festival with gaiety fervour.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathi has written a rather long letter on the Narendra Modi App, urging me to touch upon the subjects he has referred to.
He writes, “The 1 st of February is the death anniversary of astronaut Kalpana Chawla.
She left us in the Columbia space shuttle mishap, but not without becoming a source of inspiration for millions of young people the world over”.
I am thankful to Bhai Prakash ji for beginning his long letter with the sad departure of Kalpana Chawla.
It’s a matter of sorrow for all of us that we lost Kalpana Chawla at that early age, but her life, her work is a message to young women across the world, especially to those in India, that there are no upper limits for Nari Shakti …. the power of women.
If one possesses the will & the determination, a firm resolve to achieve something, nothing is impossible.
It’s a matter of joy that women in India are taking rapid strides of advancement in all fields, bringing glory to the Nation.
In our country, respect for women, their status in society and their contribution has proved to be awe inspiring to the entire world, since ancient times.
There has been a long tradition of Vidushis… women exponents or women champions.
Many Vidushis of India have contributed in composing the verses of the Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee…it’s a long list of names.
This means, a daughter is the equivalent of ten sons.
The ‘Punya’ that you earn through ten sons amounts to the same earned through just one daughter.
This underscores the importance that has been given to women in our society.
And that is why, in our society, women have been accorded the status of ‘Shakti’.
They have always brought glory to the Nation.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi has further cited some examples.
He writes that the flight of our courageous Defence Minister Nirmala Seetharaman in a Sukhoi 30 fighter plane is inspirational for him.
He also refers to INSV Tarini, with an all women crew on board under the command of Vartika Joshi, which is currently circumnavigating the globe.
Three braveheart women Bhavna Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become fighter pilots and are undergoing training on the Sukhoi- 30.
An Air India Boeing jet with an all woman crew led by Kshamata Vajpayee flew from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and back.
These are all women achievers.
A few days ago, Hon’ble President took an initiative.
He met a group of extraordinary women who have achieved something significanty new in their respective fields.
Women achievers of our country… the first female Merchant Navy Captain, the first female passenger train driver, the first female fire fighter, the first female Bus Driver, the first woman to set foot on Antarctica, the first woman to reach Mount Everest… ‘First Ladies’ in every field.
Our woman power achieved extraordinary feats, breaking the age old shackles of social mores, creating new records.
It will infuse afresh energy, newer enthusiasm into them.
A book has beencompiled on these women achievers, first ladies, so that, the entire country comes to know about the power of these women and derive inspiration from their life work.
This is also available as an e-book on the Narendra Modi Website.
The country’s woman power has contributed a lot in the positive transformation being witnessed in our country & society these days.
Today, as we speak of women empowerment, I would like to refer to a railway station.
You must be wondering what a railway station has got to do with women empowerment.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India which is run by an all woman staff.
All departments have women performing duties… the commercial department, Railway Police, Ticket checking, Announcing, Point persons, it’s a staff comprising over 40 women.
This time, after watching the Republic Day Parade, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media that a major highlight of the parade was the BSF biker contingent comprising women participants.
Daredevil stunts performed by them was awe inspiring for our foreign guests.
Empowerment is another form of self reliance.
In a short span of time, a umber of women have become part of this phenomenon.
This has three benefits- on the one hand self-employment has empowered them; on the other, the Maoist infested region is witnessing a transformation.
Time and again we keep hearing people utter ‘There is something special that we as a people possess… no threat is big enough to annihilate our existence’.
That ‘Something’ is flexibility, the ability of transformation.
Leaving out things that are beyond the constraints of time and accepting betterment in things wherever necessary.
We have inherited this Indian tradition as a cultural legacy.
The benchmark of any living society is its self correcting mechanism.
In our country, there have been unending endeavours against social ills and evil practices, both individually & collectively.
Just a while ago, Bihar launched an interesting initiative.
In order to uproot social ills in the state, the world’s longest human chain spanning over thirteen thousand kilometers was formed.
This campaign made people aware of social maladies such as child-marriage and the dowry system.
The entire state thus resolved to fight against these social evils.
Children, the elderly, the youth full of energy and enthusiasm, women, girls turned out to participate in this battle.
The human chain that commenced formation from Gandhi Maidan in Patna gained momentum, touching the state borders.
In order to ensure that the fruits of progress rightly reach all sections of society, it is imperative that our society is freed of these ills.
Come, let us pledge to come together to wipe out these evil customs from our social fabric… let us build an empowered, capable New India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister, the administration, in fact every member of the human chain for this massive, special initiative towards social welfare.
Earlier, he wasn’t aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
But now that he’s come to know of the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, he has begun purchasing medicines from there and his expenses have been reduced by about 75%.
He has expressed his wish that I mention this in ‘Mann Ki Baat’, so that it reaches the maximum number of people and they can benefit from it.
Over some time lately, many have written on this subject; many of them have been telling me about it.
I too have seen videos put up on social media by beneficiaries of this scheme.
It is a matter of joy learning about happenings like these.
It gives you inner satisfaction.
The motive behind this scheme is making healthcare affordable and encouraging Ease of Living.
Medicines available at the Jan Aushadhi Centres are 50% to 90% cheaper than branded drugs available in the market.
This is great help for the common man, especially for senior citizens who require medicines on a daily basis and results in a lot of savings.
Generic medicines sold under this scheme strictly conform to prescribed standards set by the World Health Organisation.
That is why good quality medicines are made available at affordable prices.
Today, over three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This has led to not only availability of cheaper medicines, but also new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are now available at ‘Amrit Stores’ at Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jan Aushadhi Centres & at hospitals.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
It was such a striking photo that my attention was magnetically drawn towards.
The photo showed that a grandson was participating in the Clean Morna River along with his grandfather.
The second painful fact was that the river was completely filled with wild grass and hyacinth.
A lot of garbage was being dumped into the river and along its banks.
An action plan was chalked out and on January 13 th a day before Makar-Sankranti, in the first phase of Mission Clean Morna sanitation of the two sides of the bank of the Morna river at fourteen places spread over an area of four kilometers, was carried out.
Mission Clean Morna shows that if a person is determined to do something, then nothing is impossible.
Huge social reforms can be brought about through mass movements.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and the municipal corporation’s administration, all the citizens who were associated with this mass movement, I laud your efforts which are not only very much appreciated but this will inspire the other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, these days you must be hearing a lot about the Padma Awards.
These awards also attract attention innewspapers and television also.
Now any citizen can nominate any person in our country.
Transparency has been brought about in the entire process by making it operable online.
In a way, the selection of these awards has been transformed completely.
Now the identity of the awardee is not the deciding factor of the award, rather the importance of his work is increasing.
You must have heard the name of Arvind Gupta ji.
It will gladden your heart to know, that Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent all his life creating toys for children.
He has been making toys from garbage for over four decades so that children can increase their curiosity towards science.
He has been trying to get children inspired to conduct scientific experiments using waste; towards this end he has been encouraging children by showing them films made in 18 languages in three thousand schools across the country.
What a wonderful life, what a dedicated mission!
A similar story is that of Sitavaa Jodatti from Karnataka.
Not only this, she has done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women too.
You must have heard the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor tribal family.
He was employed in a small job for eking out his living, but he was also fond of painting in the traditional tribal art form.
Today, due to this hobby, he garnered respect not only in India but the entire world.
He has exhibited his paintings in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who made India proud in many nations abroad, was also recognized and he was awarded the Padma Shri.
You will be pleasantly surprised listening to the story of Keralas tribal lady Lakshmikutti.
Laxmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still resides in a hut made of palm leaves in a tribal tract amidst dense forests.
Lakshmi Ji is continuously serving society with her knowledge of herbal medicines.
Identifying her anonymous persona, she has been honoured with the Padma Shri for her contribution to society.
Subhasini Mistri is a woman who, in order to construct a hospital, cleaned utensils in the homes of others and also sold vegetables.
At the age of 23 she lost her husband due to lack of proper treatment, and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor.
They do not labour for any honor, but their work inspires us.
These people should be invited to schools and colleges to share their experiences.
Beyond awards, there should be some more efforts from our society in acknowledging their contribution.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas on January 9 th every year.
It was on the 9 th of January, when our revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond that exists between Indians in India and Indians living around the globe.
This year we organized a program on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, where all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin were invited.
You will be pleased to know that in this programme, Malaysia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Surinam, South Africa and America, and many other countries wherever our Mayors or MPs of Indian Origin exist, all of them participated.
I am happy that the people of Indian origin who live in different countries continue to serve those countries and at the same time they have maintained their strong relationship with India as well
I would thus like to thank the European Union, for recognizing the people of Indian origin and through them in making people in India and people the world over aware of their exemplary work.
The 30 th of January is the death anniversary of our revered Bapu, who showed us a new path.
What can be a bigger tribute than taking a vow that we shall tread the path of Bapu – and walk, as far as possible?
My dear countrymen, with my best wishes to all of you for 2018, my speech draws to a close.
Thank you very much.

My Co-Chair President Mugabe,
This has been a truly historic day.
We had the opportunity to listen to the whole of Africa.
Our first two Summits were limited to a few countries on the basis of the Banjul formula.
We are honoured today that all 54 African Nations are participating.
Your response is a clear affirmation that this is the right format for India and Africa to meet.
I express profound gratitude to each of you for sharing your thoughts.
There is nothing that teaches you more than the wisdom of your friends.
Your friendship and faith is a source of great pride and strength for us.
Listening to you has reinforced my conviction that partnership between India and Africa is natural, because our destinies are so closely inter-linked and our aspirations and challenges are so similar.
We will work with you to realize your vision of a prosperous Africa, based on inclusive growth, empowered citizens and sustainable development; an integrated and culturally vibrant Africa; and, a peaceful and secure Africa, which has its rightful global place and is a strong partner for the world.
I have listened carefully on how we can make our partnership more effective.
We will intensify our cooperation against terrorism and rally the world to build a common cause against it.
Excellencies, we are conscious of the shadow that falls between an idea and action, between intention and implementation.
We should intensify our cooperation and collaboration to seek reforms of the United Nations; achieve our shared goals in global trade; build a global partnership for the Development Agenda 2030; and, pursue our expectation from the Paris Meet on Climate Change.
A world shaped in our vision and aspirations will give us each a better chance to succeed.
Today, we have adopted the Declaration of this Summit and the Framework for Strategic Cooperation.
But, more than numbers and documents, the biggest outcome is our renewed friendships, stronger partnerships and greater solidarity.
Excellencies, given the scale of our Summit and the ambitious goals of our partnership, we have jointly agreed that the Summit should be held every five years.
I thank my ministerial colleagues, our officials and the city of Delhi for making this Summit a great success.
As this day ends, our partnership has received new energy and purpose from you today and the World, new confidence in its future.
PM addresses the Closing Ceremony of the Centenary Year celebrations of Patna High Court
The Prime Minister spoke of the great power of technology, and said the bar, bench and court should all be techno-savvy.
Thank you very much, for your wonderful welcome to this beautiful city.
One of the hallmarks of this beautiful nation is its vibrant diversity.
And, no city celebrates this diversity better than the city of Durban and the province of Kwazulu Natal.
You have also recognized 1.25 billion of my countrymen.
I say this because it was here in 1860 that the first Indians landed in South Africa.
On 16 November 1860, the ship TRURO touched the shores of port Natal with 342 Indians.
But, they do not live only for themselves.
Friends,The history of our people to people ties provides a strong foundation to build our modern day partnership.
Today, India is undergoing an economic transformation.
And, South Africa is one of the leading economies of Africa.
The passion and love for this game runs wide and deep in our societies.
And, cricket has been an important part of our relations.
But, India’s economic advance is not for the benefit of our society alone.
The embrace of our partnership is open to the larger good of Africa and our friends like South Africa.
Earlier today, I visited Pheonix.
We feel the shock, pain and outrage of the people of France.
India stands firmly with the great people of France in dealing with this tragedy.
It is further provided that the information received from Israel in respect of a resident of India can be shared with other law enforcement agencies with authorisation of the Competent Authority of Israel and vice versa.
The Protocol further provides for ‘Limitation of Benefits’ Article as an anti-abuse provision aimed at preventing misuse of the Convention.
The provisions of this Article enable use of the provisions of domestic law and measures concerning tax avoidance or evasion in the event of misuse of the Convention.
Friends, We believe, Potential + Policy + Planning + Performance leads to Progress.
The Task Force will prepare overall strategy for sports facility, training, selection procedure and other related matters.
The Task Force will comprise of members who are in house experts as well as those from outside.
The SPV will develop the port infrastructure including dredging and reclamation, construction of breakwater, ensuring connectivity links etc.
At present, there are only a few ports in India that have sufficient draft and can match global cargo handling efficiencies.
Currently, all of India’s trans-shipment traffic gets handled in Colombo, Singapore and other international ports.
Indian port industry loses out upto Rs 1,500 Crores of revenues each year.
Establishing this Major port at Enayam will not only act as a major gateway container port for Indian cargo that is presently trans-shipped outside the country, but also become a trans¬-shipment hub for the global East-West trade route.

Your Excellency Prime Minister Charles Michel,
Thank you for your remarks.
Last week has been a sad week for Belgium.
Let me say Mr. Prime Minister that we share the depth of sorrow and grief that the people of Belgium have experienced in the last 8 days.
As part of our efforts to respond to this common challenge we could resume discussions on a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.
Negotiations on Extradition Treaty and a Treaty on Exchange of Sentenced Prisoners could be concluded expeditiously.
Our two countries share a long history of friendship.
A hundred years ago, more than 130,000 soldiers from India fought in the First World War alongside your countrymen on Belgian soil.
More than 9,000 Indian soldiers made the supreme sacrifice.
Next year will mark the 70th anniversary of India-Belgium diplomatic ties.
My conversation with Prime Minister Charles Michel today covered the whole spectrum of our ties.
A system of bilateral foreign policy consultations would recommend concrete ways to upgrade our partnership.
India is one of the brightest economic opportunities in the world today.
I believe that a combination of Belgian capacities and India’s economic growth can produce promising opportunities for businesses on both sides.
Prime Minister and I have just held a productive interaction with Belgian CEOs and business persons earlier today.
I invite the Belgian government and companies to pro-actively associate with India’s ambitious development projects including Digital India, Start Up India and Skill India.
Belgian businesses can make their global supply chains more cost effective by manufacturing in India.
These partnerships can help us reach new heights in our trade and commercial partnership.
Clearly, it is not just diamonds that can bring shine to our partnership.
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges before mankind.
Prime Minister and I have agreed to enhance our cooperation in renewable energy.
Advancement in S&T and High technology areas is of particular importance for India’s development priorities.
We welcome Belgium’s collaboration in these areas.
Prime Minister Michel and I have just activated, remotely, India’s largest optical telescope.
This product of Indo-Belgian collaboration is an inspiring example of what our partnership can achieve.
The work is also afoot on other agreements in the areas of Information and Communication Technology, audio-visual production Tourism biotechnology and shipping and ports.
In a couple of hours from now, I would meet the E.U. leadership for the 13th India-E.U. Summit.
For India, E.U. is one of our strongest strategic partners.
Trade, Investment, and technology partnership between India and the E.U. would be one of the focus areas of our discussions.
I feel that a progressive path and creative mind-set to India-E.U Trade and Investment Agreement can enable all the European countries, including Belgium, to benefit from India’s strong economic growth.
I once again express my sincere gratitude to Prime Minister Charles Michel for his time, welcome and hospitality.
I look forward to welcoming him in India.
In a unique and perhaps unprecedented gesture, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted individually with over 60 athletes who will represent India at the forthcoming Rio Olympics.

“India and Bangladesh recently settled their maritime boundary using the mechanism of UNCLOS.
Unveiling of Statue of Swami Vivekananda.
The Prime Minister unveiled a statue of Swami Vivekananda at Ramakrishna Mission.
Speaking on the occasion, he said Swami Vivekananda was not just an individual, but the very soul of the millennia-old Indian culture.
He said that if we can imbibe the breadth of Indian culture, from the Upanishad to the Upagrah (satellite), we would have installed Vivekananda within us.
He said that at a time when the world was torn between materialism and spirituality, Swami Vivekananda had taken the message of Indian spirituality to the west.
He said that the ASEAN Summits that he had attended over the last two days, had an oft-repeated theme of “One Asia.”
He said that this was an idea first propounded by Swami Vivekananda.
India also exists in every Indian in every part of the world.”
“Independent India owes a debt of gratitude to Malaya-Indians.
The glory of India’s freedom struggle was written, in part, by the struggles and sacrifices of Malaya-Indians.
Thousands of your forefathers came forward to join Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.
Women poured out in large numbers from the comfort of their homes to march shoulder to shoulder with Netaji Subhash Bose,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister paid homage to the Malay-Indians “who had laid down their lives so that a free India could rise.”
“70 years ago a tragic and deadly World War came to an end.
I also pay homage to the countless Indian soldiers who lost their lives in the battle fields of Malaysia.
A majority of those who laid down their lives were Sikhs.
Their blood is permanently mixed with the soil of Malaysia.
It was a war that mattered for both our countries.
“Terrorism is the biggest threat to the world today.
It knows no boundary.
It uses the name of religion to draw people to its cause.
But, it is false.
And, it kills people of all faith.
We have to delink religion from terror.
The only distinction is between those who believe in humanity and those who do not.
I have said it before and I will say it here.
The world must come together to combat the biggest challenge of our times,” the Prime Minister said.
“In Malaysia an India-students Trust Fund was set up in 1954 to give financial assistance to Malaysian-Indian children who lacked the means for education.
This Fund is still needed by a section of the Indian community in Malaysia.
We are happy to announce a grant of about 1 million US dollars in additional funds to the corpus of the Trust Fund.
Malaysia and India should immediately recognize the degrees conferred by both our countries.

The Prime Minister reviewed the progress towards handling and resolution of grievances related to the Ministry of Labour and Employment, which largely include EPFO, ESIC, and Labour Commissioners.
13 States have completed the process of amending the APMC Act.
The Prime Minister urged the remaining states to quickly make the required changes in the APMC Act, so that e-NAM could be enabled across the country.
He said the farmer can benefit only if Assaying and Grading facilities are made available, so that the farmer can market his produce in mandis across the country.

Thank you, Shantanu, John, Satya, Paul, Sunder, and Venkatesh,
A big thank you!
Good Evening, everyone!
These are the new neighborhoods of our new world.
If Facebook were a country, it would be the third most populous one and the most connected.
Google today has made teachers less awe-inspiring and grandparents more idle.
From computing to communication, entertainment to education, from printing documents to printing products, and, now to internet of things, it’s been a long journey in a short time.
From cleaner energy to better healthcare and safer transport, everything is converging around the work you do.
An initiative by a father in Haryana for “Selfie with daughter” to draw attention to the girl child became an international movement.
By using Space technology and internet, we have been able to identify in the last few months 170 applications that will make governance better and development faster.
When a small craftsman in a village in India brings a smile to a customer looking at his phone on a metro ride in New York; When a heart patient in a remote hospital in Kyrgyz Republic is treated by doctors sitting in Delhi, as I saw in Bishkek, we know we are creating something that has fundamentally changed our lives.
The answer was a surprise for me.
But, in this digital age, we have an opportunity to transform lives of people in ways that was hard to imagine just a couple of decades ago.
For nothing else will do in a country with 800 million youth under the age of 35 years, impatient for change and eager to achieve it.
We have set up Ebiz portal to make approvals for businesses and citizens easy and efficient so that they concentrate their energy on their goals, not on government processes.
We are using technology to impart scale and speed to development.
Information, education, skills, healthcare, livelihood, financial inclusion, small and village enterprises, opportunities for women, conservation of natural resources, distributed clean energy – entirely new possibilities have emerged to change the development model.
But for all this, we must bridge the digital divide and promote digital literacy in the same way that we seek to ensure general literacy.
We must ensure that technology is accessible, affordable, and adds value.
Much of India that we dream of is yet to be built.
We have the responsibility to shape a future of peace, stability and prosperity in this region.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today congratulated Shri Harivansh, on his election as Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.

The Prime Minister noted that we are marking the anniversary of the Quit India Movement today.
He said that Harivansh ji hails from Ballia, a land which has been linked with the freedom struggle, right from the 1857 war of independence.
The Prime Minister added that Shri Harivansh has been inspired by Loknayak Jaya Prakash Narayan.
The Prime Minister recalled that Harivansh ji had also worked with former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar ji.
The Prime Minister said that working closely with Chandra Shekhar ji, Harivansh ji knew in advance that Chandra Shekhar ji would resign.
However, he did not let his own newspaper have access to this news, the Prime Minister observed, adding that this shows his commitment to ethics and public service.
The Prime Minister said that Harivansh ji is well read and has written a lot.
He added that Harivansh ji has served society for years.
Shri Narendra Modi also congratulated Shri B.K. Hariprasad for being a part of the election for Deputy Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha.
The discussions focused on subjects such as increasing the share of gas in India’s energy mix, fresh investment in oil and gas exploration in India, regulatory frameworks, international acquisition of oil and gas assets, emerging areas such as shale gas and coal-bed methane, and the oil and gas sector related possibilities of “Make in India.”

It is always a great pleasure to welcome home a special friend, which President Michel certainly is.
I am also delighted to reciprocate President Michel’s exceptional hospitality in March, this year.
He has led his country with great vision.
He is a strong global voice of concern on climate change, especially for small island countries.
Let me repeat what I said in Seychelles: Your country shows that size is no barrier to the scale of achievements.
President Michel has also been instrumental for the progress in our relationship.
President Michel’s visit has imparted additional momentum to our relations.
We have excellent security cooperation, especially for maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region.
We are honoured to be a partner in providing aircraft, naval vessels and coastal radar systems for strengthening surveillance capacities.
Our cooperation in hydrography surveys is extensive and growing.
I have conveyed that India will gift one more Interceptor Coastguard boat to Seychelles.

President and I place strong emphasis on Ocean or Blue Economy.
We have begun preparations for infrastructure development on the Assumption Island in Seychelles.
We had spoken in March about improving connectivity.
The Air Services Agreement today will enable more and easier connections between the two countries.
Climate change is a major global challenge.
It is a serious threat to island countries like Seychelles.
With a shoreline of 7500 kilometres and nearly 1300 islands, India has similar concerns.
We both have ambitious National plans for a more sustainable future.
We also work together for a comprehensive, balanced and effective outcome on climate change at COP 21 in Paris later this year.
I shared our desire to press for reforms of the United Nations, including its Security Council, in this 70th anniversary year.
We greatly appreciate Seychelles’ support for India’s candidature for permanent membership of an expanded United Nations Security Council.
This special and unique relationship will always be at the centre of our interests.
I am confident that this milestone year for our relationship will be the springboard for taking our strategic partnership to a new level.
Thank you very much.

Address to Indian Community
The Prime Minister addressed the Indian diaspora at the SAP arena.
The Cabinet observed two-minute silence in his memory and passed a condolence resolution.
The text of resolution is as follows:
He was born in Thirukkuvalai village in Nagapattinam District on 3rd June, 1924.
He had held various important positions in his public and political life during his long career in Tamil Nadu political arena.
He held the position as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu five times.
Apart from his political life and career, he has been very popular screenwriter in Tamil cinema.
He used medium of cinema for propagating the ideals of the Dravidian movement.
Dr. M. Karunanidhi was also famous for his writing and oratorical skills.
In his death, people of Tamil Nadu have lost their popular leader.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to all, who framed Indian Constitution.
“Tributes to all great personalities who framed our Constitution.
I extend a warm welcome to President Rahmon and his delegation in India.
Tajikistan is a valued friend and strategic partner in Asia.
President Rahmon himself is very familiar with India.
We are indeed delighted to have the opportunity to host him again.
In India, we deeply appreciate his leadership and contribution to strengthening our bilateral relationship.
Our strategic partnership is built on a foundation of mutual respect, trust and shared interests in regional security and development.
President Rahmon and I had fruitful discussions earlier today.
Combating terrorism has, therefore, been an important area of our cooperative engagement.
We appreciate Tajikistan’s role in the Central Asian region as a mainstay against forces of extremism, radicalism, and terrorism.
President Rahmon and I agreed today to strengthen action on this front based on mutually agreed priorities.
We will do this on multiple levels :-
India’s membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization will be a valuable platform to work closely on regional security and counter-terrorism efforts with Tajikistan.
President Rahmon and I also exchanged views on the developments in our region.
We agreed that peace, stability and prosperity in Afghanistan are important for the region.
India and Tajikistan are joined in our steadfast support of the Afghan people and their aspirations for a peaceful and prosperous nation.
President and I agreed on the need to increase the scope and scale of our economic engagement, especially trade and investment traffic.
India supports initiatives to develop the existing port and transport infrastructure and connecting it through road and rail network to Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Central Asia.
In this respect, we will work to build trade and transit links through Chahbahar port in Iran.
India is also engaged in facilitating the International North South Transport Corridor with other members, including Tajikistan.
Our planned accession to the Ashgabat Agreement will further help in linking us to Tajikistan and Central Asia.
Next year, we will commemorate the 25th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between India and Tajikistan.
I am encouraged by the wide-ranging agenda for action that President Rahmon and I have set for our countries during this visit.
I further expect that the agreements concluded today and our discussions will help boost practical cooperation in different sectors between India and Tajikistan.
In this context, he recalled the experience of officers in post-earthquake reconstruction in Gujarat, in 2001.
The Prime Minister said that officers should not look on their work as just a duty, but an opportunity to make a positive transformation for governance in the country.
He urged them to use technology interventions to simplify governance processes.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved establishment of a unified authority for regulating all financial services in International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs) in India through International Financial Srvices Centres Authority Bill, 2019.
Currently, the banking, capital markets and insurance sectors in IFSC are regulated by multiple regulators, i.e. RBI, SEBI and IRDAI.
While discussions on the path of salvation are going on here, there are people who think that who knows the future.
But the journey of Yogiji is not just a show of the path of salvation, but it speaks of the journey within.
He motivated everyone towards Kriya Yoga.
This current is now running within our hearts too.
He was spiritually active until his passing away.
It was the felicitation event for the Ambassador of India where he was delivering a lecture.
Yogiji also had written this meticulously in one of his poems.
Likewise we say that the moment “performer”” and the “Act” becomes one, there results easy achieving.
The “doer” need no “Action” thereafter and the Karma (Act) doesn’t wait for the “doer”.
Yogiji has described this reposition marvellously in his works.
Never say stop and don’t ask space for its passage.
Setting up of unhindered order is one of the prominent contribution of Yogi ji.
It is just like a family having unwritten set of rules for its routine working.
So is the theme laid down by Yogi ji that his institution is still dynamic and thrashing even after his exit from the centre stage.
And being carried away by his spiritual bliss we are also running this institution.
In my opinion this is his biggest contribution.
The world had compared and weighed India on the same terms for its population, GDP and employability on its specific global parameters.
However, the world is yet to know about one specific parameter of India which is in real terms is the strength and power is its spirituality.
This is the bad luck of this country that there are some one who are of the view that spirituality and religion are similar entities.
Caste, creed and religion are distinctly different from spirituality.
Our former President APJ Abdul Kalam repeatedly said that spiritualism is the strength of India and this must continue.
Our sages and saints have continuously furthered this spirituality globally.
For me Yoga is a very simple entry point.
Teaching the world “ Atmvat Sarvabhuteshu” will be ridiculous.
More so, the saying- “Ten Tyakten Bhunjitah” will have no buyer amid the talks of “ Eat Drink and be Marry.
So this is Yoga, the entry point for our spiritual journey.
It should not be taken as the final frontier.
Even -enlightenment in so much Dollars and for some ones Yoga is the final achievement.
Yoga is not the final thing but is the entry point of the way for final passage.
Moving uphill sometimes witnesses breakdowns.
However continuous pushing makes the vehicle accelerates ahead with momentum.
Similarly in Yoga one has to get the entry point correctly and if achieved, there will be no hindrance later on.
So once again my reverence to the great legacy of Yogi ji I bow to the saints and after extending well wishes for the persons engaged in furthering this spiritual travel ahead I stop here .

He stressed on the need for tax administrators to engender trust in the system.

Today, every Indian has been working towards realising the dream of a New India.
Indians from every corner of the country, Indians working in different sectors, present a grand view.
I’ve visited Oman nearly 10 years ago.
I was going to Africa as then chief minister of Gujarat and during that journey I had passed through Salala.
Relations between India and Oman are hundreds of, thousands of years old.
Naturally, there is a new momentum in India’s historic relations with Oman.
We are extremely grateful to him for this special gesture.
We have been working to make the life of the common man of the country easier by following the formula of: Minimum Government – Maximum Governance.
We have included all these things in culture of the government: simplification of the processes; repealing unnecessary laws; reducing the size of forms in the government office from 40-50 pages to 4-5 pages; creating system for online filling of those forms; giving a sincere hearing to the grievances of the people and work on them.
In the changed India, now the poor people are not being insultingly turned back from the banks.
The poor people have been given life and safety insurance at a premium of 90 paise per day and one rupee per day.
An amount of Rs. 2,000 crore has been disbursed as the claim to poor people under these insurance schemes.
We have announced such a scheme in the budget that has grabbed the attention of the entire world.
We have given assurance for the free treatment of up to Rs. 5 lakh to a poor family.

It’s an example of a New India.
The country’s funds are saved when the decisions are taken with a clear conscience and as per a well laid out policy.
When the work is being carried out in an efficient manner, when the present resources are being utilised in the best possible manner then the country’s funds are saved.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has greeted the people of Himachal Pradesh, on the statehood Day.
“India’s weightlifters are also lifting our position in the medal’s tally.
Well done Sathish Kumar Sivalingam for clinching a Gold in the 77 kg weight category.
My dearest countrymen namaskar.
I have come across the inquisitiveness of children, the ambitions of the youth, and the gist of the experience of elders!
What are the kinds of suggestions, what are the kinds of complaints and what are the experiences of the people?
It is an inherent human nature to advise others.
While travelling in the train or the bus if someone coughs, the next person immediately advises a cure.
To offer advice or suggest a solution, are part of our nature.
In the beginning, when suggestions came in response to a certain episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ , one could discern words of advice, and you could read them too, so our team always felt that many people might have had this particular habit of proffering advice.
But when we analyzed the suggestions minutely, I really became quite emotional.
Most of those who give suggestions or try to reach to me are those who are really doing something in their lives.
They are making efforts and are engrossed as per their intellect, capacity, ability and circumstances so that something good must happen.
And when these things came to my notice I felt that these suggestions are extraordinary.
These are suggestions that have emerged out of a certain squeeze of life’s experiences.
And upon my mention, there were mentions of many innovative ideas to save food from being wasted that are being put into practice employed in many corners of the country on NarendraModiApp and also on MyGov.
I had never even imagined that in our country especially the young generation has been doing this kind of work from a long time.
Some social institutions have been involved in this activity for many years was common knowledge, but the youth of my country are engaged in this task, I only came to know later.
In the Roti Banks, the leftover rotis are deposited by people, they also deposit the leftover vegetables and the needy can obtain food from these banks.
The person who donates rotis feels a sense of satisfaction also, the recipient also does not feel humiliated.
These are examples of how work can be achieved with the help of society.
Today is the last day of month of April.
1st May is the foundation day of the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
On this occasion, many felicitations to the citizens of these two states on my behalf.
Plans should be drawn to achieve that pledge and taken forward with the cooperation of all citizens.
I wish the very best to these two states.
There used to be a time when climate change was a subject confined to the domain of the academic world, it used to be the topic for seminars, but today, we experience it in our everyday life and it also astounds us.
Nature has also changed the rules of the game.
The heat that we used to experience in months of May-June in our country is being felt in March-April this year.
So, when I was taking suggestions for ‘Mann Ki Baat’, most of the suggestions offered related to what should be done to beat the heat during summer time.
They’ve mentioned that water should be kept in trays and utensils on the balcony and on the terrace.
I have seen that small children of the family do this very enthusiastically.
Once they understand why they should fill the pots with water they would go and inspect 10 times in a day to ensure there is water in the tray.
And also watch if the birds came or not.
We think as if it is a game going on , but in actuality, this is a novel way of instilling empathy in the child’s mind.
You can also experience for yourself that a little attachment to an animal or a bird makes you feel very happy.
In our country, we are traditionally imbued with a sense of symbiotic co-existence with animals, birds and nature yet it is necessary that collective efforts in this regard should be emphasized.
When I was Chief Minister of Gujarat, Syedna Sahib the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra Community had completed his hundred years.
He lived till 103 years.
As part of the celebration of his 100th year the Bohra community society had launched a huge campaign to save the sparrow under the aegis of Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to inaugurate it.
Nearly 52 thousand bird feeders were distributed in every nook and corner of the world.
This effort also found a mention in the Guinness book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, that we even forget to offer water to the newspaper boy, the milkman, the vegetable seller, the postman or anybody else who come to our house in peak summer days.
Young friends, I want to have a chat with you too.
I am sometimes worried that much of our younger generation prefer leading life in their comfort zones.
Parents also raise their children in a very protective manner.
True there are other extremes also but most are brought up in this comfort zone syndrome .
Now the examinations have ended and you must be done with your plans to enjoy the vacation.
Summer vacations feel good inspite of scorching heat.
But as a friend, I want to suggest you certain tips about of how to utilize your vacation.
I believe some people will put them to use and they will tell me about that too.
You must try new places, new experiences and new skills.
There is huge difference between to sometime to see something on television or reading about it in the book or listening about it from acquaintances and to experiencing the same thing yourself.
The experiment must be positive and a little out of your comfort zone.
We all belong to the middle class and happy comfortable families.
Friends have you ever thought of travelling in a Second Class railway Compartment without a reservation, and going for atleast a 24 hours ride?
In the evening, take your football or your volleyball or any other sports item and go to a colony of poor and lesser privileged people.
Play with those poor kids, you will experience a new kind of joy, the kind you would have never experienced in your life before-that’s the kind of joy you’ll experience!
Have you ever thought what changes would come in the lives of those kids who live in abject poverty when get the opportunity to play with you.
And I believe that if you go there once, your heart will tell you to go back again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many volunteer organizations are engaged in this kind of work.
Everyone has become so busy with technology in his or her own way.
Collectivity is also a way of life, collectivity is power in itself.
Today is the era of competition.
But also self-evaluate whether the human element within yourself is getting frustrated, are we not moving away from our human qualities.
Can’t a little emphasis be given on this aspect in Skill development?
If you don’t know how to swim, then learn swimming, try doing some drawing, even if you do not end up making the best drawing, try to practice putting hand to the paper!
The empathy within you will begin to appear.
Sometimes if our heart desires to learn the trade of so called ‘small people’ then let us learn it, why not?
You’re able to ride a bicycle but have you ever tried to operate the three-wheeler cycle or rickshaw which transports people?
You see, all these new experiments, these skills are such that they will bring you joy and will remove you from the limitations of life to which you’re tied down!
Do something out of the box, my Friends.
This is the only time to make something of your life.
And if you think that after appearing in all exams, at a new threshold of your career you will learn some new skill, then you won’t get a chance.
At that time you will be tangled into other things and therefore I tell you if you have a passion to learn magic then learn the card tricks!
Keep showing the tricks to your friends.
Try to know about things about which you have no prior knowledge, it will definitely benefit you.
Your inner human potential will awaken and this will provide a great opportunity for development.
I can tell you from my experience of going around the world, that the amount we can learn by seeing the world is something we cannot even imagine.
New places, new cities, new towns, new villages, new areas.
But before leaving for a particular place, preparing for the journey and upon reaching your destination gathering information about it like a seeker of knowledge, understanding about the place and having discussions with the local people, if you make an effort in this manner then the pleasure of visiting the particular place would be something else!
Do try to do it; of course do not travel too much in one go.
Go to a destination and spend three to four days there.
Then go to the next and spend a like duration there.
You will get to learn a lot that way.
I wish you share your travel photographs with me, it will be nice.
Where did you travel to !
Make good use of the hash tag Incredible India and share your experiences.
Friends, this time around, the government of India has provided you with a great opportunity.
The new generation is more or less freeing itself from the shackles of cash.
It does not need cash.
It has begun adopting digital currency.
I know you do it, but have you ever wondered that you can earn using this very scheme?
It is a scheme of the Government of India.
Refer and earn.
Generally speaking, in our country there exists an atmosphere of disdain towards the VIP culture.
But that it runs so very deep, I just experienced, when the government recently decided that no person in India, whatsoever his status might be, will not move with a red beacon atop his vehicle.
The red beacon now has gone for good but nobody can say with certainty that the same in the mindset has also disappeared.
I have received a very interesting phone call.
I wish to say something on the government’s ban on red beacons.
I read a line in a newspaper, ‘Every Indian is a VIP on the road’.
I don’t have to be caught in a traffic jam and I don’t have to stop for anyone as well.
I want to thank you from the core of my heart for this decision.
Every person has his or her own importance, every person possesses a sagacious aura, Mahaatmya, in a unique manner.
My dear countrymen, I maintain time & again that we should keep re – visiting the annals of our history, traditions and culture.
That lends us energy and inspiration.
Through his own conduct, he embraced those who were ostracized by society.
A thousand years ago, he launched an agitation allowing their entry into temples and succeeded in facilitating the same.
We are indeed fortunate that in every era, for eradicating social evils, noble souls, great men were born in this society itself.
Now that we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya, we should gain inspiration from him in our endeavour to foster social unity, to bolster the adage ‘unity is strength’.
In memory of Saint Ramanujacharya, the government of India is releasing a stamp tomorrow, the 1st of May.
I respectfully salute Saint Ramanujacharya and pay tributes to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, that is the 1st of May, carries one more significance.
In many parts of the world, it is observed as ‘Labour Day’.
And when ‘Labour Day’ is referred to, labour is discussed, labourers are discussed, it is but natural for me to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar.
It was the occasion of dedication to the nation of his collection of Vachana Amrit, the elixir of his spoken words.
In the 12th century, he had laid down his profound thoughts on labour & workers.
I distinctly remember the words of Shriman Dattopant Thengdi, the founder of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, the thinker, who deliberated a lot on the working class.
My dear countrymen, a few days from now, we shall celebrate Budha Purnima.
Followers of Lord Budha across the world celebrate the festival.
And in India, Ashok’s life perfectly epitomizes the transformation from war to enlightenment.
I feel fortunate that the occasion of the great festival of Budha Purnima is celebrated as Vesak day by the United Nations.
It will be an opportune moment to re-visit his ideals.
My dear countrymen, India has always advanced on the path of progress in the spirit of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas… inclusive development for all.
And very specially to our neighbouring countries.
On the 5th of May, India will launch the South Asia Satellite.
Wish you all the best.

The Indian Armed Forces have always been known not just for the power they represent, but by the maturity and responsibility with which they wield it.
They defend our seas and protect our borders.
They keep our Nation secure and our citizens safe.
And, in calamity and conflicts, they do more than just bring relief and hope to our people.
They lift the spirit of the Nation and win the trust of the world.
In Chennai, you battled the fury of rain and the river to save lives.
In Nepal, you served with courage, humility and compassion.
And, as in Nepal, in Yemen’s conflict, you held out your hand to every human in distress, not just fellow citizens.
Our forces reflect our Nation’s diversity and its unity.
They embody the timeless culture of India and the finest tradition of our military.
And, their success comes from the leadership that you provide.
Today, I express our Nation’s gratitude to our military.
I pay homage to those who made the supreme sacrifice, in silence and service, so that India marches ahead.
Our thoughts are with the soldiers keeping vigil on the harshest frontiers of the world; with their families that say uncertain farewells when they leave home; and, their loved ones who must sometimes bear their coffins.
So, to honour your service and uphold your welfare will always be our solemn duty.
For this reason, we have moved with speed to implement the One Rank One Pension promise that had remained unfulfilled for decades.
And, we will build the National War Memorial and Museum that you so richly deserve in the heart of our nation’s capital.
We will also improve skills and opportunities for our ex-servicemen, so that when they leave the Service, they can still serve the nation with pride and dignity.
I also pay tribute to our internal security forces.
Their valour and sacrifices defeat terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, reduce the violence of Left Wing Extremism and keep our Northeast more peaceful.
I complement our negotiators for bringing new hope in the long standing Naga problem.
India is at an exciting moment of change.
There is a high tide of hope and optimism in the country.
There is a new level of international confidence and interest in India.
We have become the fastest growing major economy in the world.
And, our economy is on a more stable path.
Our factories are humming with activity again.
We are building the next generation infrastructure at a higher pace and with an eye to the future.
Foreign Investments are rising sharply and so is India’s ranking as a place to do business in.
Every citizen can see a future of opportunities and fulfilled basic needs with confidence.
This is important for India’s prosperity, and also our security.
And, so is our security.
So, there is new intensity and purpose in our foreign policy.
In the East, we have strengthened our traditional partnerships with Japan, Korea and ASEAN.
We have made new openings in the region, including with Australia, Mongolia and Pacific Islands.
We have raised our engagement with Africa to a new level.
We have retraced our ancient links to Central Asia.
Above all, it is our neighbourhood that is most critical for our future and for our place in the world.
But, ours is a difficult neighbourhood with the full spectrum of security challenges.
Beyond that, our region is marked by uncertain political transitions, weak institutions and internal conflicts.
And, major powers have also increased their engagement in our land and maritime neighbourhood.
From Maldives and Sri Lanka in the seas to Nepal and Bhutan in the mountains, we are working to safeguard our interests and our relationships.
The Land Boundary Agreement has boosted our growing relationship and security cooperation with Bangladesh.
We are engaging Pakistan to try and turn the course of history, bring an end to terrorism, build peaceful relations, advance cooperation and promote stability and prosperity in our region.
So, we will test their intentions to define the path ahead.
For this, we have started a new NSA-level dialogue to bring security experts face to face with each other.
But, we will never drop our guard on security and we will continue to judge progress on their commitments on terrorism.
We remain committed to help the great Afghan people build a united, peaceful, prosperous and democratic nation.
We are also pursuing closer relations with China to harness the full potential of our economic partnership.
We will aim to address outstanding issues, maintain stability on the border, and develop greater mutual understanding and trust in our overlapping neighbourhood.
I believe that India and China can engage constructively across the complexity of their relationship as two self-assured and confident nations, aware of their interests and responsibilities.
We will continue to strengthen our defence capabilities and infrastructure, engage our neighbours more closely and strengthen our regional and global partnerships, including in maritime security.
In a world of rapid changes, India faces familiar threats and new ones.
Our challenges cover land, sea and air at the same time.
It includes the full range, from terrorism to conventional threat to a nuclear environment.
Our responsibilities are no longer confined to our borders and coastlines.
We know that old rivalries can play out in new theatres such as space and cyber.
And, new technologies offer us new ways to be more effective against both traditional and new challenges.
So, we in India must be ready for the present and prepare for the future.
India is confident that our defence forces are prepared to deter and defeat any misadventure.
Our strategic deterrence is robust and reliable, in accordance with our nuclear doctrine, and our political will is clear.
This includes the strategic railways to the border region.
We are transforming defence manufacturing in India through radically new policies and initiatives.
Our public sector is gearing up to the challenge.
The private sector has responded with great enthusiasm.
We can never call ourselves a secure nation and a strong military power unless we develop domestic capabilities.
This will also reduce capital costs and inventories.
In addition, it will be a huge catalyst for industry, employment and economic growth in India.
We will soon reform our procurement policies and process.
And, our offsets policy will become a strategic tool for improving our capabilities in defence technologies.
Defence technology will now be a national endeavour that taps the potential of all institutions in our country.
Armed Forces will be crucial to the success of Make in India Mission.
I am encouraged by your localization plans, especially in the capital intensive Navy and Air Force.
We want to see clear targets and goals on domestic acquisition; more clarity on specifications; and, greater involvement of our forces in innovation, design and development, especially from those who wield the weapons in the field.
Above all, we look to our Armed Forces to prepare for the future.
We also need reforms in senior defence management.
This is also a year when humanity has come together in the United Nations to combat poverty and climate change.

Distinguished dignitaries on the dais,
A very warm welcome to all the delegates from across the world to the Partners’ Forum, 2018.
Countries have moved beyond stand-alone efforts.
A lot yet remains to be done.
From bigger budgets to better out-comes, and from mind-set change to monitoring, there is lots to be done.
Hope that behavioural change can be ensured.
Hope that rapid progress can be achieved.
I firmly believe that a nation prospers when its people and importantly the women, and childrenare educated; and are able to live independent, empowered and healthy lives.
When my government assumed office in 2014, we were losing more than 44,000 mothers, annually, during child-birth.
As a result of our interventions, 840 additional lives of children under five are being saved each day in India as compared to four years back.
Children’s nutrition is being addressed through the POSHAN Abhiyan.
One thing that constantly worried us was the high out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by families to avail medical care.
We therefore launched the Ayushman Bharat Yojana.
Ayushman Bharat has a two-fold strategy.
We plan to start 150 thousand such Health & Wellness Centres by 2022.
The other arm of Ayushman Bharat is the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
This number is almost equal to the population of Canada, Mexico and the US taken together.
We have already provided free treatment worth 700 Crore rupees to 5 lakh families under this scheme within 10 weeks of its launch.
Today, being Global Universal Health Coverage Day, I again state that we will continue to work towards providing universal health coverage to all.
I instructed my officials to identify 117 ‘Aspirational Districts’.
Each such district has been entrusted to a team that works across sectors like education, water and sanitation, rural development with top-most priority to health and nutrition.
We are working on women centric schemes through other departments also.
Till 2015, more than half of Indian women did not have access to clean fuel for cooking.
This scheme enables direct benefit transfer to their bank accounts to compensate for wage loss, enable better nutrition and adequate rest before and after delivery.
I have been given to understand that over the next two days this Forum will discuss12 success stories from all over the world.

This is a time of slowdown in the global economy.
Developed countries and emerging markets are both facing slow growth.
Against this background, India is being seen as a bright spot.
Growth is projected to remain among the highest in the world.
The fiscal deficit had reached alarming levels.
The current account deficit was rising.
The current account deficit is low.

We have made progress on improving the ease of doing business.

SEBI also has a role to promote the development of healthy securities markets.
Recently, the Forward Markets Commission has been abolished.
SEBI has been given the task of regulating commodity derivatives also.
And many commodities are purchased directly by the poor and the needy, not by investors.
Hence the economic and social impact of commodity derivatives is more sensitive.
For financial markets to function successfully, participants need to be well informed.
I am happy to note that the National Institute of Securities Markets is performing the role of educating various participants and providing skill certification.
Today, our mission has to be a `Skilled India’.
Indian youth should be able to compete with their counterparts in any corner of the world.
This institute has a vital role to play in such capacity building.
I have been told that around one lakh fifty thousand candidates undertake examinations of NISM every year.
More than 5 lakh candidates have been certified by NISM till date.
India has earned a good name for its well-regulated securities markets.
The spread of electronic means of trading and the use of depositories have made our markets more transparent.
SEBI as an institution can also take pride in this.
However, there is still a long way to go for our securities and commodity markets.
As you know, my government is very keen to encourage start-ups.
Stock markets are essential for the start-up ecosystem.
However, it is not enough if the securities markets are considered as successful by international investors or financial experts.
• to the improvement of all sectors and
• to the welfare of the vast majority of citizens.
So, before I can consider financial markets to be fully successful, they have to meet three challenges.
Firstly, the primary aim of our stock market should be to help in raising capital for productive purposes.
In particular, I am referring to infrastructure.
Today, only the Government or external lenders like World Bank or JICA provide long term money for infrastructure.
We must move away from that.
Bond markets must become a source of long term infrastructure finance.
You are all aware of the huge capital requirements for improving urban infrastructure.
Secondly, the markets must provide benefits to the largest section of our society — namely our farmers.
The true measure of success is the impact in villages, not the impact in Dalal Street or Lutyens’ Delhi.
By that yardstick, we have a long way to go.
Our stock markets need to raise capital in innovative ways for projects in agriculture.
People say that derivatives can be used by farmers for reducing their risks.
But in practice, hardly any farmer in India uses derivatives.
That is the fact.
Unless and until we make the commodity markets directly useful to farmers, they are just a costly ornament in our economy, not a useful tool.
This Government has introduced e-NAM – the electronic National Agricultural Market.
SEBI should work for closer linkage between spot markets like e-NAM and derivatives markets to benefit farmers.
Thirdly, those who profit from financial markets must make a fair contribution to nation-building through taxes.
For various reasons, the contribution of tax from those who make money on the markets has been low.
Low or zero tax rate is given to certain types of financial income.
I call upon you to think about the contribution of market participants to the exchequer.
We should consider methods for increasing it in a fair, efficient and transparent way.
Earlier, there was a feeling that some investors were getting an unfair deal by using certain tax treaties.
As you know, those treaties have been amended by this government.
Now it is time to re-think and come up with a good design which is simple and transparent, but also fair and progressive.
I know that financial markets attach a lot of importance to the budget.
The budget cycle has an effect on the real economy.
Therefore, I look forward to a growing contribution from all of you in making the financial markets more relevant to this new era.
I wish the NISM all success.
We all wish our contingent for the Rio 2016 Paralympics the very best.

Here I am with my words.
It is a great privilege to speak to you at the inauguration of the second edition of the Raisina Dialogue.
Excellency Karzai Prime Minister Harper, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, it is a pleasure to see you in Delhi.
Also, a warm welcome to all the guests.
Over the next couple of days, you would hold numerous conversations on the state of the world around us.
You would debate its certainty and prevailing flux; its conflicts and risks; its successes and opportunities; its past behaviours and likely prognosis; and its potential black swans and the New Normals.
In May 2014, the people of India also ushered in a New Normal.
My fellow Indians spoke in one voice to entrust my government with a mandate for change.
Change not just of attitudes but of mindsets.
Change from a state of drift to one of purposeful actions.
Change to take bold decisions.
A mandate in which reform would not be enough unless it transforms our economy and society.
Every day at work, I draw on this sacred energy.
Every day at work, my ‘to do list’ is guided by the constant drive to reform and transform India, for prosperity and security of all Indians.
I am aware that India’s transformation is not separated from its external context.
But, the reverse is also true.
The world needs India’s sustained rise, as much as India needs the world.
Our desire to change our country has an indivisible link with the external world.
It is, therefore, only natural that India’s choices at home and our international priorities form part of a seamless continuum.
Firmly anchored in India’s transformational goals.
Because, it captures the reality of the rise of many nations.
It accepts that voices of many, not views of a few should shape the global agenda.
We inhabit a strategically complex environment.
In the broad sweep of history, the changing world is not necessarily a new situation.
The crucial question is how do nations act in a situation where the frames of reference are shifting rapidly.
Our choices and actions are based on the strength of our national power.
Our strategic intent is shaped by our civilizational ethos of:
The prosperity of Indians, both at home and abroad, and security of our citizens are of paramount importance.
But, self interest alone is neither in our culture nor in our behavior.
Our actions and aspirations, capacities and human capital, democracy and demography,and strength and success. will continue to be an anchor for all round regional and global progress.
Our economic and political rise represents a regional and global opportunity of great significance.
It is a force for peace, a factor for stability and an engine for regional and global prosperity.
For my government, this has meant a path of international engagement focused on:
· Rebuilding connectivity, restoring bridges and rejoining India with our immediate and extended geographies.
· Shaping relationships networked with India’s economic priorities.
· Making India a human resource power to be reckoned with, by connecting our talented youth to global needs and opportunities.
· Building development partnerships that extend from the islands of the Indian Ocean and Pacific to the islands of the Caribbean and from the great continent of Africa to the Americas. · Creating Indian narratives on global challenges.
And, it manifests itself several layers, multiple themes and different geographies.
Let me turn to those that are closest to us in terms of geography and shared interests.
We have seen a major shift towards our neighbours captured in our determined “Neighbourhood-first” approach.
The people of South Asia are joined by blood, shared history, culture, and aspirations.
The optimism of its youth seeks change, opportunities, progress and prosperity.
A thriving well-connected and integrated neighbourhood is my dream.
In the last two and half years, we have partnered with almost all our neighbours to bring the region together.
Where necessary, we have shed the burdens of our past for the progressive future of our region.
The result of our efforts is there to see.
In Afghanistan, despite distance and difficulties in transit, our partnership assists in reconstruction, by building institutions and capacities.
In the backdrop, our security engagement has deepened.
The completion of Afghanistan’s Parliament building and the India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam are two shining examples of our dedication to forge developmental partnership.
In Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives, our overall engagement in infrastructure, connectivity, energy and development projects is a source of progress and stability in the region.
My vision for our neighbourhood puts a premium on peaceful and harmonious ties with entire South Asia.
That vision had led me to invite leaders of all SAARC nations, including Pakistan, for my swearing in.
For this vision, I had also travelled to Lahore.
But, India alone cannot walk the path of peace.
It also has to be Pakistan’s journey to make.
Pakistan must walk away from terror if it wants to walk towards dialogue with India.
Our membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization provides a strong institutional link to our engagement with Central Asian nations.
We have invested in all round prosperity of our Central Asian brothers and sisters.
We have built a close engagement with the institutional structures in the region such as the East Asia Summit.
Our partnership with ASEAN and its member countries has served to enhance commerce, technology, investment, development, and security partnerships with the region.
It has also advanced our broad strategic interests and stability in the region.
At the same time, it is not unnatural for two large neighbouring powers to have some differences.
Prevailing wisdom tells us that this century belongs to Asia.
The sharpest trajectory of change is happening in Asia.
There are large and vibrant pools of progress and prosperity that spread across the landscape of this region.
Over the past two and a half years, we have given a strong momentum to our engagement with the United States, Russia, Japan and other major global powers.
With them, we not only share a desire to cooperate.
We also hold converging views on opportunities and challenges that face us.
These partnerships are a good fit with India’s economic priorities and defence and security.
With the United States, our actions have brought speed, substance and strength to the entire spectrum of our engagement.
In my conversation with President-elect Donald Trump, we agreed to keep building on these gains in our strategic partnership.
Russia is an abiding friend.
President Putin and I have held long conversations on the challenges that confront the world today.
Our trusted and strategic partnership, especially in the field of defence has deepened.
Prime Minister Abe and I have spoken of our determination to intensify our cooperation further.
With Europe, we have a vision of strong partnership in India’s development, especially in knowledge industry and smart urbanization.
India has for decades been at the forefront of sharing our capacities and strengths with fellow developing countries.
With our brothers and sisters in Africa, we have further strengthened our ties in the last couple of years.
And, built meaningful development partnerships on the solid foundation of decades of traditional friendship and historical links.
Today, the footprint of our development partnership stretches all across the globe.
India has a long history of being a maritime nation.
In all directions, our maritime interests are strategic and significant.
We also believe, that the primary responsibility for peace, prosperity and security in the Indian Ocean rests with those who live in this region.
Ours is not an exclusive approach.
We appreciate the compelling logic of regional connectivity for peace, progress and prosperity.
In our choices and through our actions, we have sought to overcome barriers to our outreach to West and Central Asia, and eastwards to Asia-Pacific.
True to our traditions, we have shouldered the international burden of our commitments.
We have led assistance and relief efforts in times of disaster.
We were a credible first responder during the earthquake in Nepal, evacuation from Yemen and during humanitarian crises in the Maldives and Fiji.
We have also not hesitated in shouldering our responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.
We have increased collaboration on coastal surveillance, white shipping information and fighting non-traditional threats like piracy, smuggling and organized crime.
We have an ambitious agenda and an equally aggressive target to generate 175 giga watts from renewable energy.
And we have already made a good start.
We have shared our civilizational traditions to promote harmonious living with nature.
We also brought the international community together to create an International Solar Alliance, to harness the energy of sun to propel human growth.
A high point of our efforts has been the revival of international interest in the cultural and spiritual richness of India’s civilizational stream.
Today, Buddhism, yoga and Ayurveda are recognized as invaluable heritage of humanity as a whole.
In conclusion, let me say this.
As a society, we have always favoured needs of many over the want of one.And, preferred partnerships over polarization.
Our journey of transformation begins at home.
And, is strongly supported through our constructive and collaborative partnerships that span the globe.
And in this endeavor, you will find in India, my friends, a beacon of peace and progress, stability and success, and access and accommodation.
Thank you very much.

We have been celebrating this festival of independence, at a time when our daughters from states of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Manipur, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have come back after circumnavigating the seven seas.
They have come back amongst us by (unfurling tricolour in seven seas) turning the seven seas into the colour of our Tricolor.
Our young tribal children, those who live in our forests in the far-flung areas, they have enhanced the glory of the tri-colour by unfurling it on the Mount Everest.

India has become the sixth largest economy of the world.

It came with the resolve of making a new India.
India should be self-reliant, strong, always on the path of sustainable development.
When dreams, hard work and aspirations of 125 crores people come together, what can’t be achieved?
This is the strength of India.
If you take into consideration the work that has been done in the last four years, you will be surprised to see the speed at which the country is moving and the pace at which the progress is being made.
Had we worked at the speed of 2013 , it would have taken centuries in making India 100% open defecation free or electrifying every part or even providing the LPG gas connection to every woman in rural and urban areas.
Had we worked with the speed of 2013, an entire generation would have taken to connect the country with optical fibre.

The minimum support price for many crops has been increased to more than 1.5 times the input costs.

International solar alliance is being welcomed throughout the world.
Today we see a magnificent impression of North East in the field of sports.

We are getting progressive news about highways, railways, airways, waterways and information ways (I-ways) from North East.
Our youths from the North East are establishing BPO in their areas.
The North East region has turned to be a hub of organic farming.
In our country 65% of our population consists of 35 year old people.
Our youth has brought a paradigm shift in the nature of job.
Whether it is startup, BPO or e-commerce or the field of mobility, our youth has entered into new fields.
Now a days our youth is committed to take this country to new heights.
13 crore people have availed MUDRA LOAN which is a great achievement.
Of this 4 crore are youth who have availed loan for the very first time and are self-employed and progressing independently.
India has resolved to send manned spacecraft to the space by 2022.
India will be the fourth country to do this.
Now we are focussed on bringing modernisation and advancement in the field of agriculture.
We have dreamt of doubling farmer’s income by 75th year of Independence.
We want to expand the horizons of agriculture with the help of modernization.
We want to adopt value addition right from ‘seeds – to –market’.
For the first time we are progressing in the path of Agriculture Export Policy so as to enable our farmers to emerge powerful in the world market.
Now new avenues of organic farming, blue revolution, sweet revolution, solar farming have emerged on which we plan to move ahead.
In fisheries, India has emerged second largest country of the world.
The export of honey has doubled.
It is a matter of pleasure for the sugarcane farmers that the production of ethanol has tripled.
In rural economy, the other sectors are also important.
We want to increase the resources of rural area, with the creation of women self-help groups, mobilizing billions of rupees.
We want to enhance the efficiency of villages and we are making efforts in this direction.
Now the sale of Khadi has doubled.
Our farmers are now focussing on solar farming.
Due to this he can contribute to agriculture and at the same time earn money by sale of solar energy.
Along with economic progress and development, we also want to focus on dignity of human life which is supreme.

Now under this scheme any person can get relief from diseases by going to the good hospitals.
Each family will get 5 lakh rupees health coverage annually.
We give utmost importance to technology and transparency.

With this objective technology tools have been developed.
New avenues are emerging for middle class families and youth in the field of health.
New hospitals will be constructed in 2 tier and 3 tier cities.
Medical staff will be established in huge numbers.
Employment opportunities will be more in the years to come.
During the period of four years we tried to empower the poor.
One international organisation has reported that during the last two years, 5 crore poor people have crossed the poverty line.
There are several schemes for empowerment of poor.
But the middlemen are taking away the benefits and poorer people are unable to get the benefits.
Government is making efforts to close all the leakages.
We are on the path of removal of corruption and black-money.
Due to all these efforts we were able to mobilize 90000 crore money to the Government Exchequer.
The honest pay taxes.
With their contribution schemes are implemented.
The credit goes to taxpayer and not to the Government.
Upto 2013, for the past 70 years the direct tax payers were only 4 crore people.
Now the numbers has doubled and grown to 7.25 crores.
For the period of 70 years, indirect tax officials were able to mobilize 70 lakhs of revenue.
Whereas by implementation of GST, within a year we were able to mobilize 16 lakhs of revenue.
We cannot tolerate black money and corruption.
Let there be many obstacles.
But I can’t leave them.
Now power brokers are not visible in the streets of Delhi.
In order to maintain transparency we have launched online process.
We have utilized Information Technology to the maximum level.

Everybody should feel the trauma.
We have to liberate this country, and society from the clutches of this demonic attitude.
Law is doing it’s own business.
We have to make efforts to attack this attitude.
We have to attack this type of thinking.
We should remove these types of perversion.
Triple Talak has endangered the lives of Muslim women.
Those who did not get Talak (divorce) are also sailing in the same boat.
We made an effort to alleviate the grief of Muslim women by bringing an act in the Monsoon Session of Parliament.
But even today there are some people who do not want to pass the Bill.
Due to the efforts of security forces and endeavours made by State Governments, and also due to the implementation of Central and State Government developmental schemes and the people’s participation, Tripura and Meghalaya have been liberated from the Armed Forces Special Power Act.
The way shown to us by Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the matters of Jammu and Kashmir is the best way.
We would like to go in the same path.
In the months to come, rural people of Jammu and Kashmir will be able to enjoy their rights.
They will be able to take care of themselves.
Government of India gives enough money to Gram Panchayaths which will be useful for development.

We don’t want the path of confrontation.

We don’t want to bow our head before anybody.
We have to scale new heights.

The facility will also provide training facilities for personnel in the specialized areas in the field of biomedical research.
Last month, all of us were celebrating Diwali.
Like every year, this Diwali too, I had gone to the border, to the China border, to celebrate the occasion with our soldiers, our jawans.
The heartening effect of the novel way in which our 1.25 billion countrymen dedicated this Diwali to soldiers of our army, to our defence forces, was clearly evident on their faces.
And when I saw those letters, I used to be amazed at the magnitude of creativity and emotions behind this endeavour.
A soldier wrote to me – Mr. Prime Minister, we soldiers have all the festivals like Holi and Diwali on the borders.
It felt as if we were celebrating Diwali together with a hundred and twenty five crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, this warmth of emotion, this fervour that has been kindled in the hearts of our defence forces, our soldiers this Diwali, should this be confined to only a few occasions?
When the entire nation stands by the armed forces, their might mutiplies a hundred and twenty five crore times.
A few days ago, all Pradhans from the villages of Jammu & Kashmir had come to see me.
They were from the Jammu & Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
They had come from different villages of the Kashmir valley, there were around 40-50 Pradhans.
I got an opportunity to speak to them at length.
These village Pradhans spoke about these topics with such affection and openness that everything touched my heart.
Recently, just a few days ago, when the Board examinations were held, 95% of the sons and daughters of Kashmir, the young students appeared in the examinations.
The sheer volume of students, who appeared in the Board Examinations, is a clear indication that our children from Jammu & Kashmir are committed to attain newer heights of progress, to build a bright future through the medium of education.
For their resolute zeal I congratulate these students and I also felicitate their parents, their kith and kin, their teachers and all the Gram Pradhans as well from the depths of my heart.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I asked people for suggestions for ‘Mann ki Baat’, I can say that almost all the suggestions that were received echoed one theme.
Everyone wanted me to speak in more detail about the 500 & 1000 rupee notes.
On the 8th of November at 8 in the evening, in my Address to the Nation, I had talked about launching a mega campaign to bring about reforms in the country.
When I had taken this decision and presented it before you, then also I had said openly that it was not an ordinary decision, it was one fraught with difficulties.
It was a very important decision but implementation of that decision is equally important.
These maladies have been afflicting us for the past 70 years and the campaign for getting rid of these can never be an easy task.
I can very well understand the problems you are going through!
500 and 1000 rupee notes and such a vast country, wide proliferation of currencies, billions and trillions of bank notes and amidst that, this decision – the whole world is minutely observing, every economist is analysing it, evaluating it.
The whole world is watching – will hundred and twenty-five crore Indians finally attain success after facing numerous hardships?
This question may be there in the world community.
However, India has nothing but faith and faith only and supreme confidence in her hundred and twenty five crore countrymen that they will certainly fulfill their resolve.
Across the country, central government, state governments, all units of the local self government institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, over one and a half lakh post offices, over a lakh Bank-Mitras are relentlessly at work, day and night, with complete dedication.
In the midst of immense and varied stress, all these individuals are working hard, maintaining a calm and composed demeanour, taking it as a Yagya of Service to the Nation, an attempt towards a great transformation.
Their capabilities were manifested.
Today, once again, they have accepted the challenge and I do believe that the steely resolve of one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen, their collective demonstration of PURUSHARTH will go a long way in investing our nation with a new power and strength on its path of progress.
But vices are so widespread and deep-rooted that even today there are people whose vicious habits refuse to die.
Even now, some people think that they can re-introduce into the system, money from corruption, black money, unaccounted wealth and Benami money (money in unknown person’s name), using some route or the other.
The saddest part is that, for this too, they have chosen to misuse the poor, the underprivileged people.
By misguiding the poor, enticing them through the vices of avarice and temptation, wrongfully pumping money into their bank accounts, or getting them to undertake some wrong activities, some people are trying to save their black money.
And the law regarding Benami property that has been enacted and is being implemented is very stringent and it is going to be extremely tough on wrong doers.
The government does not wish that our countrymen should face undue hardships.
Your move to demonetize 1000 and 500 rupee notes is a commendable step.
I wish that in Mann Ki Baat, you quote instances of people, who, despite facing hardships, have welcomed this step for the nation’s progress.
This will further enhance people’s zeal.
A cashless economy is necessary for nation building.
I have received a similar call from Mr. Yellappa Velankar Ji from Karnataka: –
For this I thank you from the core of my heart.”
We get to know certain things through media, through the people and through government sources which add to our enthusiasm for work.
Please, do have your food and pay later whenever you happen to pass through this place.
So people go and eat there and make payments on their next visit after 2, 4 or 6 days.
This is the strength of my country which encompasses the spirit of service, of sacrifice and also of genuineness and honesty.
During elections, I used to have ‘चाय पर चर्चा’, that is discussions over tea and this got publicised around the whole world.
People in many countries of the world even learnt to utter the phrase – ‘Chai Par Charcha’.
But, I did not know ‘Chai Par Charcha’ could be linked to a marriage also.
Guests from the bridegroom’s side also gracefully accepted it as their ceremonial welcome.
Bharat Maaroo and Dakshaa Parmar from Surat, through their marriage, have made a valuable contribution in the ongoing fight against corruption and black money and set up a very inspiring example.
Whenever confronted by such difficult times, people do succeed in exploring and finding good avenues and solutions.
I once saw in the news on TV, when I had returned late in the night, a report about a small village called Dhekiajulli (धेकियाजुली) in Assam, where tea workers reside.
These tea workers get their wages on weekly basis.
Now, what they did when they received a 2000 rupee note as wages?
People are themselves finding ways.
And just look at this change.
The government received a message that people of tea gardens in Assam are demanding setting up of ATMs in their areas.
See, how the village life is also getting transformed.
On the basis of reports received from about 45-50 cities, I gathered that demonetisation had encouraged people there to pay their arrears accumulated due to non-payment of dues earlier; many people were in the habit of not making tax payments such as water tax, electricity bills, etc., they just did not pay.
Now all of us know very well that the poor people always like to clear their dues 2-3 days in advance.
It is the well-off people, who do not pay their taxes and bills as they have higher connections and know that nobody is going to ask or do anything against them.
Thus there are big arrears of payments, which remain pending.
All municipalities receive hardly 50% of their tax revenues.
But, this time after the decision taken on the 8th instant, people rushed to deposit their old currency notes.
Imagine the difference – from 3 to 3.5 thousand crores to 13 thousand crores.
Now that these municipalities have received 4 times the money, it is quite natural that poor localities and slums will get better drainage facilities, better water supply and better Aanganbari system.
Many such examples are coming to light where direct benefits of this demonetisation can clearly be seen.
Brothers and sisters, our villages and our farmers are strong pillars of our economy.
Our farmers have discovered new avenues amidst the present difficulties.
The government has also taken many important decisions, wherein priority has been accorded to our farmers and villages.
Small traders and businessmen of our country provide employment opportunities besides adding to the economic activities.
But naturally they too had to face difficulties due to this decision.
You can see how the big malls are expanding their business with the help of latest technology.
A small trader can also expand the business with the help of this user friendly technology.
There is no possibility of things going wrong, but there certainly is an opportunity to grow.
You can create a full-fledged banking facility on your mobile phone and there are many ways now to run our business without using paper currency.
I want to tell my worker brothers and sisters too that you have faced heavy exploitation.
Wages shown on paper are much higher than the wages actually paid to you.
If sometimes full wages are paid, someone stands outside to forcibly take his cut and the worker is compelled to accept this as his fate.
We want that under this new system you should have a bank account; your wages should be deposited directly into your bank so that payment of minimum wages is ensured.
And, once the money is credited into your bank account, you can use your mobile phone as an e-wallet and you do not need any hi-fi smart phone for this, because even with the help of your ordinary mobile phone itself you can make purchases from the neighbourhood shops and make payments as well.
I specially want to talk to our young friends today.
I know, dear young men and women of my country, that you have liked my decision.
I also know that you support my decision.
I even know that you are making a big contribution in positively taking this mission forward.
But dear friends, you are my true soldiers, my true partners.
Dear youngsters, can you please help me?
You will be with me but that alone is not enough.
The older generation does not have the exposure and experience of the new world which you possess.
Possibly your elder brother and even your parents and uncles and aunts also may not know.
You know what an ‘App’ is, what ‘online banking’ is and how ‘online ticket booking’ is done.
For you these are routine things and you also make use of them.
But, the great task that the country wants to accomplish today is the realisation of our dream of a ‘Cashless Society’.
It is true that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible.
You know how many opportunities there are today for a cashless society, for digital banking or for mobile banking.
Every bank provides online banking facility.
Every bank in India has its own ‘mobile App’.
Every bank has its wallet.
Wallet simply means an e-purse.
Various types of cards are available.
Just as there is a prepaid card for mobile phones, prepaid cards are also available in banks to facilitate expenditure.
UPI is a very useful platform for carrying on trade activities which enables you to make purchases, send money and even receive money.
And, this procedure is as simple as sending messages through WhatsApp.
Even an illiterate person today knows how to send and also forward WhatsApp messages.
Not only this, with the simplification of technology, we do not require any big smart phones for this purpose.
Cash can be transferred even with a phone with ordinary features.
A washerman, vegetable vendor, milk supplier, newspaper vendor, tea stall owner or a chanaa vendor, everyone can easily use this facility.
My dear young friends, despite all these things, there is an entire generation which is ignorant in these matters.
And I know it very well that all of you are actively contributing in this great task.
Today when we are passing through the times of such gigantic changes, your original creativity is manifesting itself within you.
You just do one thing, take a resolve today itself that you will yourself become a part of the ‘cashless society’.
Every technology needed for online spending will definitely be available on your mobile phone.
But not only this, you must devote half an hour, one hour or two hours daily to educate at least 10 families about what this technology is, how this technology is to be used, how to download the Apps of your banks, how to spend money from one’s account, how to make payment to shopkeepers.
Also teach the shopkeepers to conduct their business with this technology.
You have to voluntarily lend your leadership to this great campaign, this Maha Abhiyan, to create a ‘cashless society’, to eradicate corruption from our country, to abolish the scourge of black money and to help people in overcoming their difficulties and problems.
Once you teach the poor people about the usage of Rupay Card, they will shower their blessings upon you.
We can emerge and take our place in the world as a new modern India within a period of one month.
And you can do this through your mobile phone by going to 10 houses daily and bringing 10 families daily under the ambit of this campaign.
I invite you – come, do not just support this transformation but become one of its leading soldiers and ensure that we achieve the desired transformation.
Kenya made a resolve and set up a mobile based system M-PESA, adopted appropriate technology which was named M-PESA and today in Kenya, in this region of Africa, total business is ready to shift to this system.
That country has brought about a big revolution.
My dear young friends, I once again earnestly appeal to you to take forward this campaign.
I invite you to work for this mission individually and collectively in every school, in every college, in every university, in NCC and in NSS.
We must take this forward.
We have got an opportunity to render a great service to our nation; this chance must not be missed.
Dear brothers and sisters, today is the birth anniversary of a great poet of our country – Shriman Harivansh Rai Bachchan Ji and on this occasion today, Shriman Amitabh Bachchan Ji has given a slogan for Swachhta Mission.
You must have noticed, that Amitabh Ji, the most popular actor of this century, has been whole-heartedly promoting the campaign for cleanliness.
I respectfully bow to Harivansh Rai Ji.
I also thank Shriman Amitabh Ji to connect in such a warm manner with ‘Mann Ki Baat’ and for taking forward the Cleanliness Campaign.
My dear countrymen, now your views and your sentiments on ‘Mann Ki Baat’ though your letters, on MyGov, on NaarendraModiApp keep me constantly connected with you.
Presently Mann Ki Baat is broadcast at 11 AM but we are going to start its broadcast in regional languages immediately after my Hindi broadcast.
I am grateful to Akashvani for taking up this initiative which will definitely provide an opportunity to connect our countrymen even in those areas, where Hindi language is not prevalent.
Many thanks to all of you.

Distinguished dignitaries
Greetings to all
The award belongs to the success that India has achieved in the less than five years, powered by the strengths and skillsof one point three billion Indians.
And so, on their behalf, I humbly accept the Award and express my gratitude.
This award is a recognition of the philosophy that has given the message of वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम which means the entire world is one family.
May there be peace every where in the sky in space,
all over our planet, in nature.
May there be eternal peace.
And, this award is for the people who have always put societal good above individual ambitions.
And, I am honoured that this award is being conferred on me in the year that we celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The Seoul Peace Prize was established to mark the success and spirit of the 24th Summer Olympics held in Seoul in 1988.
India remembers the games quite well.
Because they ended on Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday.
The games showcased the best of Korean culture,the warmth of Korean hospitality, and the success of the Korean economy.
And,not to forget, they marked the arrival of a new sporting power-house in the global arena!
But,the games were also an important landmark in world history.
The 1988 Olympics were held at a time of many changes in the world.
The Iran-Iraq War had just ended.
The Geneva Accords relating to the situation in Afghanistan had been signed earlier that year.
Health-care and education outcomes have been improving.
And, India is doing her part.
We have been working to improve the well being of the people of India – who form one-sixth of humanity.
India is today the fastest growing large economy in the world with strong economic fundamentals.
This has been possible because of the major economic changes that we have introduced.
Flag-ship initiatives such as ‘Make in India’, ‘Skill India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Clean India’ have contributed to visible socio-economic growth.
We have focused on financial inclusion, access to credit, digital transactions, last mile connectivity, andsupport to small and medium enterprise so as to spread development across the country and enrich all the citizens of India.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is making India clean; From a sanitation coverage of around 38% in 2014, the number today stands at 98%!
The Ujjwala Yojana is improving the lives of rural women through use of clean cooking fuel; Ayushman Bharat is providing health-care and insurance to 500 million poor and vulnerable people; and, Through these initiatives, and many more, we have contributed to holistic development and India’s march towards achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
In all our efforts, we are guided by Mahatma Gandhi’s teaching that we should recall the face of the poorest and the weakest person that we have ever seen and ask ourselves if the step that we plan is going to be of any benefit to that person.
As the third largest economy, our growth and prosperity will inevitably contribute to global growth and development.
We are committed to make a peaceful, stable and economically inter-linked world.
India, as a responsible member of the international community, has also been in the fore-front of our collective fight against climate change.
Despite having a historically low carbon foot-print, India has been playing an active role in the global fight against climate change.
At the domestic level, this has been done by unveiling a National Action Plan to reduce carbon emissions, increase forest cover, and replacing traditional carbon fuels with renewable energy supplies.
On the international plane, we have partnered with like-minded countries to launch the International Solar Alliance, which aims to harness the clean and unlimited solar energy as an alternative to fossil fuels.
We are one of the largest troop contributing countries for UN peace-keeping operations.
And, we are proud to have been able to contribute to peace on the Korean peninsula.
We have extended a helping hand to countries in need and participated actively in humanitarian work and disaster relief.
We have carried out operations in conflict zones and rescued not only Indians but also nationals of many other countries.
We have been an active and considerate development partner for other developing countries, with our guiding principle being to help in developing their physical and social infrastructure.
Through these efforts, we seek to ensure that the benefits of a globalised and inter-connected world are equally experienced by all.
Over the past few years, my Government has renewed interaction and forged new partnerships across continents.
In the East Asian context, we have redefined our engagements with countries in the region, including with Republic of Korea, under our Act East Policy.
I am glad to hear an echo of our approach in President Moon’s New Southern Policy.
India has been the land of peace for ages.
The people of India have practiced the concept of peace and harmonious co-existence for thousands of years.
With hundreds of languages and dialects, many states, and major religions, India is proud to be one of the most diverse nations in the world.
We are proud that ours is a land where people of all faiths, beliefs, and communities can prosper.
We are proud that ours is a society based not only on tolerance, but on celebration of differences and diverse cultures.
Like Korea, India has also suffered the pain of cross-border strife.
Our endeavour towards peaceful development has only too often been de-railed by cross-border terrorism.
While India has been the victim of cross-border terrorism for over 40 years, all nations today face this grave threat which respects no borders.
The time has come for all those who believe in humanity to join hands to completely eradicate terrorist networks and their financing, supply channels, and to counter terrorist ideology and propaganda.
Only by doing so can we replace hate with harmony; destruction with development; and, transform the landscape of violence and vendetta into a post-card for peace.
Progress over the past year towards peace on the Korean peninsula has been heartening.
President Moon deserves all the praise for the role he has played in overcoming the legacy of mutual distrust and suspicion between the D.P.R.K. and the international community, and bringing them to the discussion table.
This is no small achievement.
I state again my Government’s strong support to the ongoing dialogue process between the two Koreas and between the U.S.A. and D.P.R.K.
As the popular Korean saying goes:
“A good beginning is half the battle”.
I have every confidence that with continued efforts from the Korean people, peace will soon prevail on the Korean Peninsula.
Friends, I would like to end by quoting a portion of the 1988 Olympics Theme Song, because it perfectly captures the hopeful spirit for a better tomorrow for all of us: Hand in hand, we standAll across the land,We can make this world,A better place in which to live.
Best wishes for a fruitful & inspiring tenure.
In his message, the President has said, “Please accept my warm greetings and good wishes on your birthday.

We hope that during this visit you would feel the same warmth and hospitality that we have felt during our visit to Switzerland in 2016.

Today, we had a comprehensive and meaningful discussion on bilateral, regional and global issues.
Our strong bilateral relations have progressed further through this visit.
We also discussed Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement between Indian and European Free Trade Association.
Be it black money or dirty money, or be it money laundering or be it the funds linked to arms and drugs.
Our cooperation with Switzerland is ongoing to deal with this global curse.
Last year, we had signed a joint statement for automatic exchange of tax related information.
Under this agreement, the information will be automatically shared with us upon completion of the internal processes of Switzerland.
Foreign Direct Investment is a crucial basis for our economic relations and India particularly welcomes the Swiss investors.

Today, during our discussion with the business leaders of both the countries, we felt that they have a strong desire to constantly increase the business to business collaboration for mutual benefit.

PM replies to the motion of thanks on President’s Address in the Rajya Sabha

Mr. Dmitry Rogozin, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi today afternoon.
Prime Minister welcomed Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin to India on his third visit this year.
It is not every day that one meets a prime minister representing 1.2 billion people, one considered a superstar at home and abroad.
Maybe that is why the meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi felt so special.
Modi is a different kind of leader.
This should be a badge of honor for all Israelis.
That is his big challenge.
He takes immense pride in his success in pulling himself up by the bootstraps after being born into poverty.
Loosely translated, it means, “In the interest of all, for the benefit of all, together with all, development for all.”
Throughout the interview, he makes a conscious effort to point out the deep ties between the Indian and Israeli peoples.
He believes the two nations are soulmates.
Q. What do you know about Israel?
Have you ever visited Israel?
“I got firsthand experience of Israel during my visit to Israel in 2006, as chief minister of the Indian State of Gujarat, to take part in an Agritech exhibition.
“I share the view of many of my fellow citizens about Israel.
These include articles ranging from USB flash drives to cherry tomatoes.
The way you transformed yourself from being a water-deficient country to a water-surplus country; the manner in which you made your deserts bloom, are all amazing accomplishments.
All these images have made a deep imprint on my mind.”
Q. Why have you made a decision to go ahead with this historic visit?
“Bilateral ties between our countries have always been strong.
In fact, over the years, they have been continuously expanding and diversifying.
In the recent past, the steady strengthening of our ties has begun finding reflection and reinforcement in high-level visits.
You would have noticed that the frequency of exchanges has gone up over the last three years.
No Indian president or prime minister had visited Israel before our president visited in 2015.
President Reuven Rivlin’s visit to India in 2016 was only the second Israeli presidential visit to India.
“My forthcoming visit reminds us of the deep and centuries old connect between our societies.
I think that this year, as we celebrate 25 years of our diplomatic relations, it is an opportune occasion to take the relationship to a new level.”
Q. Does this decision imply a more pro-Israel posture in the U.N.?
“Our positions at the U.N. are based on the merit of specific issues and driven by our core values and principles.
India is not in favor of singling out any country at the U.N.”
Q. Does India still consider itself unaligned with either the West or the East?
We want to engage constructively with both the East and the West.
Q. Are Israel and India facing the same threat of terrorism?
“Terrorism is a global menace.
India and Israel are not immune to it either.
We are in full agreement that elements which perpetrate violence on innocent people should not be allowed to flourish.
Cross-border terrorism is a major challenge for us.
Divisive forces across our border are trying to disrupt the unity of our nation.
These troublemakers often misuse religion as a tool to misguide youth in our country and our regions.
Terrorism should not be equated with any particular religion.
“The principal objective of my visit is to deepen bilateral relations between India and Israel.
I am sure I will visit Jerusalem.
Q. What is your position on the question of sovereignty in Jerusalem?
Will India move its embassy?
“We believe in a two-state solution in which both Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist peacefully.
A final-status agreement should respect the sentiments and address demands of all affected parties.
The key to finding a solution to this issue lies with the affected parties.
India supports all efforts to find an acceptable solution to all the pending issues, including Jerusalem.
I assume the question refers to our embassy in Tel Aviv.
We will take a decision on that after both sides have come to an agreement on Jerusalem.”
Can you explain what shaped your worldview?
“I do not believe in any ‘-isms.’
I, and my government work with the motto of ‘Together with all, development for all.’
We want our youth to become not just job-seekers but job-givers.
We will adopt all measures necessary to unlock the innovation and entrepreneurial potential of our youth.
My yardstick for supporting or advocating any course of action is the net benefit or value it brings to the lives of our people.
And when this consideration is put first, the results can be deeply rewarding.
Q. You have tried to reform Indian society, in part by the use of modern technology in remote and rural communities that lack proper sanitary conditions.
Can Israel play a role in this?
Israel could be a technology partner in this process of transformation.
Israel’s capabilities offer a good match for our flagship schemes like Clean Ganga [the effort to clean the Ganges River] and Smart Cities.
Israeli technologies could also be used to improve the quality of lives of hundreds of thousands of people in our country if Israeli innovators remodel their products according to the needs of our rural population.
It is important to understand market trends among the rural sections.”
Q. What is the difference between the approach Israelis and Indians have when it comes to business, agriculture and other fields?
“As societies, India and Israel are both driven by a strong entrepreneurial mindset.
Q. How can we describe to the average person what innovation ties are there between Israelis and Indians?
Our perspective on innovation may be varied by but we both rely on it to add wealth and value to our societies.
Israelis and Indians are innovative by birth.
India and Israel both support and sustain unique innovation ecosystems.
Our common effort is also to link the creativity of innovation with the energy of entrepreneurship.
Q. What kind of Israeli imports does India seek?
“We are not looking at a traditional import-export relationship with Israel.
It is more than a buyer-seller relationship.
We are more interested in a tech-based partnership with an emphasis on ‘Make in India.’
The Israeli industry has been fairly positive to many of our flagship schemes like ‘Clean Ganga.’
There is tremendous scope for deepening the extent of partnership in India’s flagship schemes.”
“Greetings to people across India on the various festivals.
May this auspicious day bring joy & prosperity in everyone’s lives.
Wishing the people of Assam on the auspicious occasion of Bohag Bihu.

On the special occasion of Vishu, I convey my good wishes to the people of Kerala.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the International Conference on Frontiers in Yoga Research and its applications, at Jigani, Bengaluru.
This is a particularly special year for the science of yoga.
On June 21, more than a million people in 192 countries came together to celebrate the first International Day of Yoga.
The overwhelming global support is a mark of Yoga’s growing international popularity.
It is also a symbol of the universal aspiration for health and well being.
It is this spirit of unity that demonstrates the timeless science of yoga.
This is a recognition that is dawning on the world.
And, across cultures and geography, people are increasingly taking to yoga to redefine their lives – to find oneness between their inner self and outer world; between their existence and their environment.
The WHO fact sheet on the global burden of disease says that non-communicable diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide.
Some studies have estimated that India stands to lose about 4.58 trillion dollars before 2030 due to non communicable diseases and mental health conditions.
So, we must address the question of psychological state of our existence as much as we try to advance our physical and material life.
This is where the role of Yoga is paramount.
Across the world, there are moving stories of transformed lives and rekindled hopes due to Yoga.
The prediction of Shri Aurobindo that “Indian Yoga … is potentially one of these dynamic elements of the future life of humanity” is coming true.
This discipline was not originally considered or conceived as system of medicine.
But, because Yoga is about aholistic lifestyle and the physical, mental, intellectual, emotional, moral and spiritual harmony, it has profound health benefits.
It fits well with the change in the way that world increasingly defines health.
We are no longer satisfied with just preventing and managing diseases.
Traditional Indian systems are rooted in looking at human beings in totality.
They see the link between Adhi or problems at the mind level and Vyadhi or problems at the physical level.
They may at times take longer to take effect, but they tend to have deeper and longer impact.
And, they are without side effects.
As I argued at the Science Congress this morning, like traditional knowledge, science has also evolved through human experiences and exploration of Nature.
So, along with the accumulated wisdom and experience gathered over the ages, we must also apply the techniques and methods of modern science to test and validate results, assure quality and explain benefits.
And, this is why we are placing emphasis on our efforts to increase awareness, acceptance and adoption of AYUSH System of Medicine.
And, in doing so, we will create better wellness among people, rely more on local resources and reduce healthcare costs.
We will also reduce the social and economic costs to our society and promote a more environment friendly healthcare system.
I am not here to advocate the supremacy of one system over another.
I believe that humanity is wealthier for its diversity.
Civilisations, cultures and countries have enriched each other by sharing their knowledge and wisdom.
And, we can progress more by learning from each other.
It is in this spirit that Swami Vivekananda called for combining the best from the East and the West.
So, it must be in the area of healthcare.
My vision for healthcare is an integrated system that understands and builds on the best and most effective of different traditions.
It addresses issues that are very close to my heart.
Breakthroughs in medicines and vaccines have helped conquer and contain many diseases.
But, as our understanding of its limitation and its side effects have grown, as we have experienced the growing costs of modern medicine systems, we have begun to look beyond to traditional systems, not just in India, but in other countries as well.
Their popularity is growing.
Yoga is now a global heritage.
And, the world is embracing traditional Indian medicine with great enthusiasm.
So, we look to you at this conference to define the path forward in the service of humanity.
I hope that health professionals, policymakers, government organizations and Industry will bridge the distance between the various forms of medical systems.
You will contribute not only to healthier and happier life for people, but also to a more prosperous and peaceful world, and a more sustainable future for our planet.

He said people in India too would be pleasantly surprised to see the cow being given such importance as a means of economic empowerment in villages, in faraway Rwanda.

Since its introduction in 2006 hundreds of thousands have received cows through the Girinka program.
By June 2016, a total of 248,566 cows had been distributed to poor households.
The program has contributed to an increase in agricultural production in Rwanda – especially milk production and products, reduced malnutrition and increased incomes.
The program also aimed at promoting unity and reconciliation among Rwandans based on the cultural principle that if a cow is given from one person to another, it establishes trust and respect between the giver and beneficiary.
While this was not an original goal of Girinka, it has evolved to become a significant aspect of the program.
The program also follows a certain criteria in choosing who the beneficiaries should be.
As per a Govt. of Rwanda official, they mainly look at those very poor vulnerable families that don’t own a cow but do have land that can be used to grow grass for feeding the cows.

And wherever they have gone, they have created a mini-Gujarat.
Gujarat is currently in the midst of the Kite Festival.
May the kites inspire us all to fly high.
As I have often said India’s strength lies in the three Ds: Democracy, Demography and Demand.
Our biggest strength is the depth of our Democracy.
Some people say that democracy cannot deliver effective and fast track governance.
But we have seen in the last two and a half years that it is possible to deliver quick results in a democratic set up as well.
Over the last two and a half years, we have also evolved a culture of healthy competition among states.
States are being rated on parameters of Good Governance.
The World Bank is helping us in this process.
Coming to Demography, ours is a nation of vibrant youth.
The disciplined, dedicated, and talented youth of India offers a globally unmatched work-force.
The seas that surround the Indian peninsula, connect us to some of the world’s biggest markets, including Africa, the Middle East and Europe.
Nature has been kind to us.
Our three crop seasons enable us to grow food, vegetables and fruits in abundance.
The diversity in our flora and fauna is unparalleled.
The richness of our culture and its living symbols is unique.
Our Institutions and scholars are recognised the world over.
India is now an emerging R&D hub.
We produce the world’s second largest number of scientists and engineers.
Our entertainment industry is making waves worldwide.
All this helps ensure a good quality of life, at relatively low cost.
Our Government was elected first and foremost on the promise to provide clean Governance and end the prevailing regime of corruption and nepotism.
It is our vision and mission to bring a paradigm shift in the ways of our polity and economy.
We have taken a series of decisions and steps in this direction.
To give you some examples, we are bringing a shift:
In doing this, digital technology has played a key role.
Online processes help bring speed and openness in decision making.
Towards this end, we are working to adopt and absorb newer technologies, to bring about transparency, and to end discretion.
Believe me, we are on the threshold of becoming the world’s most digitised economy.
Most of you wanted this change in India.
I am proud to say that it is happening before you.
Over the last two and a half years, we have worked relentlessly to realise India’s potential, and to set right the economy.
India has become the fastest growing major economy in the world.
Creating an enabling environment for business, and attracting investments, is my top priority.
We have to do this in order to create opportunities for our youth.
With that spirit, we are moving towards implementation of some historic initiatives.
This includes the Goods and Services Tax.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the National Company Law Tribunal, a new arbitration framework and a new IPR regime are all in place.
India’s rank has improved considerably, in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report.
India is ranked third in the list of top prospective host economies for 2016-18 in the World Investment Report 2016 released by UNCTAD.
Our rank also improved by thirty two positions in World Economic Forum’s ‘Global Competitiveness Report 2015-16 and 2016-17’;
We have moved up sixteen ranks in the ‘Global Innovation Index 2016’ brought out by WIPO and other institutions;
We have moved up nineteen positions in the World Bank’s ‘Logistics Performance Index of 2016.’
You can see that we are moving closer to global best practices.
Day by day we are getting more and more integrated with the world.
Our confidence has been boosted by the positive impact of our policies and practices.
This also gives us the motivation to further simplify our processes to become the easiest place to do business.
We have liberalised our FDI regime in many sectors and in various ways.
India is today among the most open economies.
This change in environment has been recognized by both domestic and foreign investors.
An encouraging Start-up eco-system is now taking shape in the country.
This unleashing of the youth power is heartening.
The total FDI inflows in the last two and a half years have touched US Dollars one hundred and thirty billion.
The FDI equity inflow in the last two financial years was sixty per cent higher as compared to previous two financial years.
In fact, the total FDI inflows received during the last year have been the highest ever.
It also continues to be among the top ten countries globally in terms of FDI inflows.
India has left every other country behind in terms of providing return on investment.
In 2015, India has risen to first position in the Baseline Profitability Index.
Make in India has become the biggest brand that India has ever had.
It is directed towards making India a global hub for manufacturing, design and innovation.
We are committed to an India with:
· Better job opportunities;
· Better quality of life;
· And better living standards.
This includes Freight Corridors, Industrial Corridors, High Speed and Metro Rail projects, Logistics Parks, Smart Cities, Coastal Zones, regional airports, water, sanitation and energy initiatives.
Our per capita electricity consumption must rise.
Even as we do so, we are committed to promoting renewable energy.
India is going to emerge as one of the world’s largest construction markets as it adds millions of homes.
All this offers unprecedented opportunities for the investor community.
· From hardware to software;
· From defence systems to cyber security
· From medicine to tourism;
I daresay, that India alone offers the opportunities that could rival those of an entire continent.

Dear scientists,
The Nobel Prize is the world’s recognition at the highest level for creative ideas, thought and work on fundamental science.
But, today, we are making history by having a galaxy of Nobel Laureates in Gujarat.
I extend a hearty welcome to all the Laureates present here.
You are valued friends of India.
Some of you have been here earlier several times.
One of you was born here and actually grew up in Vadodara!
I am delighted to see so many of our young students here today.
I ask all of you to urge all your friends and family to visit the Science City over the coming weeks.
Our students will cherish this extraordinary experience of interacting with you.
It will inspire them to undertake new and significant challenges that hold the key to our shared sustainable future.
I am very hopeful that this exhibition and this Series will become a strong link between you and our students, science-teachers and our scientists.
My Government has a clear vision of where we want India to be in the next 15 years.
Science and Technology is the pivot on which that vision will translate into strategy and action.
Our vision in Science and Technology Is to make sure that opportunity is available to all our youth.
That training and future preparedness should make our youth employable in the best places.
That India should be a great science destination.
That we should take major inspirational challenges such as deep sea exploration and Cyber Systems.
We have a plan that will take this vision through action.
Our scientists have been asked to develop programmes on science teaching in our schools across the country.
This will also involve training teachers.
You will be able to compete for positions and jobs here and anywhere in the world.
Your start-ups and industry can then compete globally.
India offers an enabling and unique opportunity of a large demographic dividend and the best teachers.
Young students, you are the streams that charge the wells of knowledge and expertise.
Your training and your future is what this is all about.
Thanks to science and technology, the human race has flourished.
The maturity of our science will also be judged by a responsible treatment of our planet by the wise use of Science and Technology.
You will be scientists soon and the guardians of the planet.
We must have clear outcomes from the Nobel Exhibition and the Science City.
Globally, science & technology has emerged as one of the major drivers of socio-economic development.
In the fast growing Indian economy, there are increasing expectations for scientific interventions.
There are three outcomes I would like to see from the Nobel Prize series.
First, follow up with students and their teachers.
Do not lose track of them.
During the exhibition period, you may also have sessions for school teachers from all over Gujarat.
Second, stimulate entrepreneurship locally.
There is a great entrepreneurial zeal amongst our youth.
Our science ministries have incubators here in Gujarat.
In the next five weeks, you should have a workshop on how cutting edge science and technology-driven start-ups can be boosted.
I am told that there are about ten Nobel Prize winning discoveries that have gone into the making of a smart phone.
Prize winning Physics can both save electricity bills and the planet.
The 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics was for the BLUE LED.
This came from basic research by three Japanese scientists Akasaki, Amano and Nakamura.
When combined with the previously known RED and GREEN LED, white light devices can be made that last a hundred thousand hours.
Many Nobel Prize winning discoveries have had a huge impact on our society through health and agriculture.
It is an ideal platform to engage citizens to learn about solutions to global challenges we face.
Centre and State should collaborate and take up this challenge this year.
My young friends!
You are the foundation and the future of India.
You should build new ranges from which the peaks will arise.
If we focus on the foundation, in our schools and colleges and through teachers all miracles can happen.
There will be hundreds of peaks from India.
But, if we neglect the hard work at the base no peak will magically appear.
Be inspired and be daring, have courage and be your own person and not imitative.

My loving greetings to all.
It is my honour to be here, in this august gathering.
That too, on the auspicious occasion of Maha-Shivratri.
There are many festivals, but this one is pre-fixed with “Maha.”
Indeed, there are many Devs, but only one Maha-Dev.
Maha-Shivratri symbolizes a union of divinity with a purpose, of overcoming darkness and injustice.
It inspires us to be courageous and fight for good.
It marks the shift of seasons, from the cold to the lively spring and brightness.
Maha-Shivratri celebrations go on for the entire night.
This symbolizes a spirit of vigilance- that we have to protect nature and mould our activities in sync with our ecological surroundings.
My home state, Gujarat is the land of Somnath.
The call of the people and the longing for service took me to Kashi, the land of Vishwanath.
From Somnath to Vishwanath, from Kedarnath to Rameshwaram and from Kashi to Coimbatore where we have gathered, Lord Shiva is everywhere.
Through centuries, there have lived countless devotees, in every age and time.
They came from different places.
Their language may have been different but their longing for the divine is always the same.
This longing throbs in the core of every human heart.
Their poetry, their music, their love has soaked the very earth.
Today, Yoga has come a long way.
There are various definitions, types, schools of Yoga and ways to practice Yoga that have emerged.
Otherwise, we may just have to discover a new Yoga to re-discover the soul and essence of Yoga.
Yoga is the catalytic agent, ushering the transformation from Jiva to Shiva.
Oneness with our families, with the society we live in, with fellow humans, with all the birds, animals and trees with whom we share our beautiful planet…this is Yoga.
The diversity has been India’s greatest strength and has also brought India together.
Think of Lord Shiva and the picture that comes to mind is that of his majestic presence at Mount Kailash, in the mighty Himalayas.
Think of Goddess Parvati and you remember the beautiful Kanyakumari, which is surrounded by the vast oceans.
The union of Shiva and Parvati is a union of the Himalayas with the oceans.
Shiv and Parvati… this is by itself a message of oneness.
And look at how this message of oneness further manifests itself:
Around the neck of Lord Shiva, there is a snake.
The ‘Vahan’ of Lord Ganesh is the mouse.
We are well aware of the frosty relations between a snake and a mouse.
Even then, they live together.
The family of Lord Shiva is diverse yet the spirit of harmony and unity is vibrant.
Diversity is not a cause of conflict for us.
We accept it and embrace it whole heartedly.
That animal, bird or tree is also worshipped with the same spirit as the God or Goddess.
There cannot be a better means to inculcate a spirit of reverence for nature.
These are values we have seen our ancestors live and die for.
These are virtues that have kept the Indian civilization alive for centuries.
Our mind should always be open to new thoughts and ideas from all sides.
Unfortunately, there are a select few, who in order to hide their own ignorance, take a very rigid view and destroy any scope of welcoming new thoughts and experiences.
Rejecting an idea just because it is ancient can be potentially harmful.
It is essential to analyse it, understand it and try to take it to the new generation in a manner in which they understand best.
The progress of humanity is incomplete without the empowerment of women.
The issue is no longer women development but it is women-led development.
I am proud of the fact that in our culture the role of women is central.
They shattered stereotypes, broke barriers and became trendsetters.
You would be interested to know, that in India we say –नारी तू नारायणी, नारी तू नारायणी – woman is a manifestation of the divine.
A mother is someone who is unconditionally inclusive.
The changing lifestyles of the 21st century have brought their own set of challenges.
Lifestyle related ailments, stress related diseases are becoming more and more common.
There is ample evidence that practicing yoga helps combat stress and chronic conditions.
If the body is a temple of the mind, yoga creates a beautiful temple.
That is why I call Yoga a passport to health assurance.
More than being a cure to ailments, it is a means to wellness.
Yoga is about Rog Mukti (freedom from diseases) as well as Bhog Mukti (desisting from worldly greed).
Yoga makes the individual a better person in thought, action, knowledge and devotion.
It would be very unfair to see Yoga only as a set of exercises that keeps the body fit.
You may see people twist and turn their bodies in many sorts of fashion.
But they are not all yogis.
Yoga is far beyond physical exercises.
Through Yoga, we will create a new Yuga – a Yuga of togetherness and harmony.
When India mooted the idea of the International Yoga Day at the United Nations, it was received with open arms.
The world celebrated both the Yoga Days, 21st June 2015 and 2016 with greatfervour.
The coming together of so many nations to mark the International Day of Yoga illustrates the real essence of Yoga- togetherness.
I see people full of energy and enthusiasm to offer themselves to a greater cause.
Adiyogi will inspire many generations to take up yoga.
My gratitude to Sadhguru for bringing this to us.

Honourable Governor of Andhra Pradesh and Chief Minister;
My Cabinet colleagues;
Delegates of Foreign Navies;
Brave and proud men and women of the Indian Navy; and
The resolute people of this great city- Visakhapatnam.
I am privileged to visit Visakhapatnam.
The city has a special place in the heart of all Indians.
My last visit to Vishakhapatnam was in October of 2014.
At that time, Cyclone Hudhud had left the city shattered in pieces.
But, the people of Vishakhapatnam smiled in the face of adversity.
It is a tribute to the city that within 14 months, you have risen against all odds to welcome the Navies from across the continents in this International Fleet Review.
A little over a year ago, we saw the full fury of the ocean.
Today, thanks to the spirit of the people of Visakhapatnam, we are discussing how the oceans can be a source of economic prosperity for all of us.
For its courage and resolve, we all salute the city of Visakhapatnam.
My profuse thanks to the men and women of the Indian Navy for their tireless dedication for making this Fleet Review a truly historic success.
My sincere gratitude also to Chief Minister Chandrababu Naiduji for his strong support for this international event.
For me personally, witnessing the harmony among the best of International Navies here has been a rewarding experience.
A few weeks earlier in August 2015, India had hosted in Jaipur 14 Heads of the State for the Second Forum for India-Pacific Island Cooperation.
Just day before yesterday, we welcomed all the SAARC countries for the 12th South Asian Games in Guwahati.
On behalf of my countrymen, I thank you all for accepting our invitation and joining in this event with such spirit.
To build on the gains from today’s gathering, India would host the first ever Global Maritime Summit in April this year.
Its priority would be to scale up and strengthen the vibrant trade / investment / technology and commercial linkages between India and other maritime Nations.
The oceans and world’s waterways are global commons.
The last time India hosted the International Fleet Review was in the year 2001, in the city of Mumbai.
The world of 2016 is vastly different.
Its politics is turbulent, and its challenges complex.
At the same time, the oceans are the lifelines of global prosperity.
They present us with great economic opportunities to build our nations.
Over 90% of global merchandise trade is carried on the oceans.
Over the last 15 years, its value has grown from about 6 trillion dollars to about 20 trillion dollars.
Our ability to reap economic benefits from the oceans rests on our capacity to respond to the challenges in the maritime domain.
Piracy too remains a strong challenge.
The threat of natural disasters like tsunamis and cyclones is ever present.
A peaceful and stable maritime environment is, therefore, critical for the regional and global security.
It is also a must to harvest the riches of the oceanic ecosystems.
Given the scale and complexity of modern day challenges, the international maritime stability cannot be the preserve of a single nation.
It has to be a shared goal and responsibility of all the seafaring countries.
To this end, the Navies and maritime agencies of the world need to work together, and engineer virtuous cycles of cooperation.
But, where necessary, they also need to act to secure the international sea lanes of communication.
I believe that if oceans were to propel our economies, then we must:
• Use seas to build peace, friendship and trust, and curb conflict;
The large presence of foreign Navies at this Fleet Review is a confirmation of our shared urge to walk the pathways of peace and cooperation to keep the maritime domain safe and secure.
India is, and has always been, a maritime nation.
India’s ancient Sanskrit texts also refer to the oceans as the storehouse of Chaturdashanam Ratnanam, the 14 gems.
Surrounded by sea from three sides, India has a long coastline of over 7500 kilometres.
Since the days of the Indus Valley Civilization, India has maintained an extensive network of maritime links, including with Africa, Western Asia, the Mediterranean region, the West, South East Asia and the Far East.
We are delighted that the Navies from all these regions have joined in this Fleet Review.
The Photo Essay book on the ‘Maritime Heritage of India’, that I have just released, showcases this glorious maritime tradition.
About half of world’s container traffic; and close to one-third of world’s cargo traffic passes through this region.
90% of our trade by volume and 90% of our oil imports are carried on the seas.
India’s 1200 island territories, and our huge Exclusive Economic Zone of 2.4 million square kilometers makes clear the economic significance of the Indian Ocean.
For us, it also serves as a strategic bridge with the nations in our immediate and extended maritime neighbourhood.
In March last year, in Mauritius,I had spelt out our vision for the Indian Ocean.
The Indian Ocean Region is one of my foremost policy priorities.
To this end, India’s modern and multi-dimensional Navy leads from the front.
It is a force for peace and good.
A network of growing political and economic maritime partnerships, and strengthening of regional frameworksalso helps us pursue our goals.
India’s quest for economic prosperity through oceans is a part of our larger efforts to transform India.
We are not just a bright spot in the global economy.
Regionally and internationally, we are a pillar of stability and an important growth centre.
India’s rise is in harmony with the goal of maintaining the regional and global peace and security.
This optimism comes from the energy and enterprise of our confident youth.
In a week from now, on 13 February, we would hold 7 days of global engagement under “Make in India” in Mumbai.
Our “Skill India” program is building institutions that train, support, encourage and guide our 800 million youth on the path of entrepreneurship.
Our skilled youth are ready to respond to the national and global manpower demands of the 21st century.
An important part of India’s transformation is my vision of “Blue Economy”
The Blue Chakra – or the wheel – in our National Flag, represents the potential of the Blue Economy.
An essential part of this pursuit is the development of India’s coastal and island territories: but, not just for tourism.
In partnership with all the coastal states of India, I want to shape a special program of skilling India’s youth in the coastal areas of the country.
In the end, let me once again congratulate the Indian Navy for the flawless conduct of this grand event.
For the homeward journey of all our Naval friends from across the world, may you always have fair winds, following seas, and many a fathom below your keel.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Greetings on the occasion of International Yoga Day!
This morning, I was delighted to join thousands of people from different walks of life, to celebrate this occasion, in the beautiful city of Dehradun, in the foot-hills of the Himalayas.
For the last few days, I have been seeing pictures of people participating in the celebrations, across the world.
Indeed, in just three years, this event has grown into a world-wide public movement.
It has become an integral part of public life in many countries.
Its impact has expanded far beyond its day of observance.
In India, I perceive three different themes in the observation of International Day of Yoga.
I am sure, this is the case in many other countries as well.
Second, it is an occasion when those, who are already introduced to Yoga, re-dedicate themselves to its pursuit.
The third theme is to spread the good word.
Thousands of individuals and institutions, who have already gained from Yoga, reach out to those that still have not.
In the process, International Day of Yoga, has even come to be celebrated as a festival, by many across the world.
The word Yoga, means ‘to unite’.
Therefore, this surge of interest in Yoga, fills me with hope.
I hope that Yoga can become a binding force for the world.
I am happy that you have chosen the International Day of Yoga, for the inauguration of this Nature Cure Centre.
I hope that this Centre shall strive to strongly integrate elements of Yoga, in all its programmes and initiatives.
Traditional Indian knowledge systems, such as Yoga and Ayurveda, help us stay healthy.
They guide us to overcome inherent weaknesses of both body and mind.
These are systems, which treat individuals with care and respect.
Modern lifestyle takes a toll on the body as well as the mind.
The focus of conventional systems of healthcare, unfortunately, is more on cure, rather than on prevention.
There is no denying that we need conventional medicine to address the huge health challenges of today.
But it is also a fact that there are gap areas that remain un-addressed.
Healthcare specialists all over the world now appreciate the fact that systems like Yoga and Ayurveda can complement the conventional medicine system extremely well.
These holistic systems focus on wellness and disease prevention.
Adoption of these holistic practices leads to increased health and wellness in individuals and in communities.
Contrary to the perception of some people, Yoga is not limited to exercises and postures .
It involves a deep search into mind, body and spirit.
It leads to a greater understanding of one-self.
I have always believed that Yoga has no religion.
Modern Yoga practices often include various elements of ancient wisdom.
These include moral and ethical principles, postures designed to keep the body fit, spiritual philosophy, instruction by a guru, chanting of mantras, quieting the breath and stilling the mind through meditation.
Yoga focuses on changing the lifestyle of the individual, so that lifestyle related disorders are easily prevented and managed.
The belief that certain yogic postures and Pranayama help to control many diseases has been widely held in India for centuries.
Now, modern science has stepped in to generate supporting evidence for this.
Science has also demonstrated that through Yoga, it is possible to exercise control over the functions of many organs in the body including heart, brain, and endocrine glands.
Today, interest in Yoga is growing rapidly in Western countries.
It would be no exaggeration to say that Yoga has been appreciated a lot by the Western world.
Several modern medical institutes of USA and Europe have adopted Yoga as an alternative or adjunct treatment for many disorders.
Of late, a lot of research has been undertaken in Yoga.
The Government of India is committed to implement evidence based traditional systems of healthcare in public health.
We have also launched nation-wide programmes for the prevention and control of non communicable diseases.
India is a big country with the world’s second largest population.
It is also significant that their objective is life-long wellness.
I assume that respect for authenticity and faith in scientific approach are inherent to these objectives.
With such an approach, the Centre can contribute significantly to the wellness movement, and take the benefits of Yoga to a large number of people in the USA.
I wish you all the very best for this venture.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said there can be no bigger inspiration than Mahatma Gandhi, for pursuing the vision of Swachh Bharat.

The Prime Minister said Swachhta or cleanliness is a matter of habit.
Once this habit is inculcated, an individual cannot tolerate an unclean environment.

This needed to be corrected, the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister said that upto 1000 children die daily in India, due to unhygienic conditions.
If 125 crore people decide that India must be clean, it can be ensured, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister commended the efforts of the award winners, and said their work would serve as inspiration for many others.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Financial Services Commission (FSC), Gibraltar for mutual co-operation and technical assistance.

On 14 November, I will have the honour to be the first Head of Government to deliver the Keynote Address at the Singapore Fintech Festival.
As the world’s largest event on financial technology, the Festival is the right forum not only to showcase India’s strengths in this fast-growing sector, but also to forge global partnerships for fostering innovation and growth.
During my visit, I will also have the opportunity to interact with the participants and winners of the joint India-Singapore Hackathon.
It is my firm belief that if we provide the right encouragement and a nurturing ecosystem, our youth has the ability to become global leaders in providing solutions to the challenges facing humanity.

A group of about 30 “solar mamas” from Tanzania and a few other African countries demonstrated their skills in fabrication, repair and maintenance of solar lanterns and household lighting systems to the Prime Minister today.
They also presented their honey-extraction and stitching practices and sung a song “we shall overcome”.
Barefoot College, Tilonia (Rajasthan) has been promoting and training rural women solar engineers (solar mamas) from Africa in fabrication, installation, use, repair and maintenance of solar lanterns and household solar lighting under Government of India supported programmes.

The establishment of the NAA, to be headed by a senior officer of the level of Secretary to the Government of India with four Technical Members from the Centre and/or the States, is one more measure aimed at reassuring consumers that Government is fully committed to take all possible steps to ensure the benefits of implementation of GST in terms of lower prices of the goods and services reach them.
It may be recalled that effective from midnight of 14th November, 2017 the GST rate has been slashed from 28% to 18% on goods falling under 178 headings.
There are now only 50 items which attract the GST rate of 28%.
Likewise, a large number of items have witnessed a reduction in GST rates from 18% to 12% and so on and some goods have been completely exempt from GST.
The “anti-profiteering” measures enshrined in the GST law provide an institutional mechanism to ensure that the full benefits of input tax credits and reduced GST rates on supply of goods or services flow to the consumers.
Affected consumers who feel the benefit of commensurate reduction in prices is not being passed on when they purchase any goods or services may apply for relief to the Screening Committee in the particular State.
However, in case the incident of profiteering relates to an item of mass impact with ‘All India’ ramification, the application may be directly made to the Standing Committee.
In the event the NAA confirms there is a necessity to apply anti-profiteering measures, it has the authority to order the supplier / business concerned to reduce its prices or return the undue benefit availed by it along with interest to the recipient of the goods or services.
If the undue benefit cannot be passed on to the recipient, it can be ordered to be deposited in the Consumer Welfare Fund.
In extreme cases, the NAA can impose a penalty on the defaulting business entity and even order the cancellation of its registration under GST.

Your Excellency Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha Ladies and Gentlemen
It is a great pleasure to welcome you to India.
Your visit is a high point in our top-level political exchanges.
You come from a land that is very familiar to us.
From the Legend of Rama to the Wisdom of Buddha our ties are founded on a shared cultural heritage.
Our historical people-to-people ties provide a strong basis to our partnership.
Today, Prime Minister and I reviewed the full range of our bilateral engagement:
From culture to commerce;
From closer contacts between our peoples to deeper connectivity; and
From counter-terrorism to defence and security.
We are both aware that rapid spread of terrorism and radical ideology poses a common challenge to both our societies.
And, we also recognize that our close security partnership would help us to secure our peoples from these threats.
In our shared objective to combat these challenges, India is particularly grateful to Thailand for its assistance and cooperation.
Beyond terrorism, we have agreed to further deepen our security engagement in the fields of cyber security, narcotics, transnational economic offenses and human trafficking.
The land frontiers of our two countries are not far apart.
And, we are also maritime neighbours.
So, Prime Minister and I have agreed to forge a closer partnership in the fields of defence and maritime cooperation.
A partnership to meet our bilateral interests ; and to respond to our shared regional goals.
And a partnership, which will be shaped by:
Sharing of expertise and experiences;
Greater staff exchanges and more exercises;
Cooperation on counter-piracy on seas;
Deeper engagement in naval patrolling; and
Building linkages in the field of defence R&D and production.
Trade and commerce flows are an important lifeline of the interdependent world today.
Alongside trade, there are also ample avenues for greater manufacturing and investment linkages.
We see a particular synergy between Thai strengths in infrastructure, particularly tourism infrastructure, and India’s priorities in this field.
Information Technology, pharmaceuticals, auto-components, and machinery are some other areas of promising collaboration.
We also see early conclusion of a balanced Comprehensive Economic and Partnership Agreement as our shared priority.
Prime Minister and I are fully aware that smooth flow of goods, services, capital and human resources between our economies needs a strong network of air, land and sea links.
We have, therefore, prioritized completion of India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral highway; and early signing of the Motor Vehicles Agreement between our three countries.
Connectivity is also an area of priority for India’s development.
Improving access to Southeast Asia from our Northeastern States benefits both our peoples.
Stronger connectivity is essential not just for expanding bilateral trade ties.
It also brings our people closer and facilitates enhanced science, education, culture and tourism cooperation.
Next year, to commemorate the seventy years of establishment of our diplomatic relations, we will celebrate Festival of India in Thailand, and Festival of Thailand in India.
This year, India is also celebrating one hundred and twenty-fifth birth anniversary of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of Indian Constitution.
I am delighted that the Indian Constitution will soon be translated into Thai language.
India has always deeply appreciated the warmth and affection of the Royal Family of Thailand for India.
We also look forward to the honour of receiving His Royal Highness Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn in India at his earliest convenience.
In conclusion, let me say that the convergence of Thailand’s ‘Look West’, and India’s ‘Act East’ policy lights the path to a bright future of our partnership.
Recalling his promise of delivering One-Rank, One-Pension for the armed forces personnel, the Prime Minister said the Union Government had fulfilled this promise, with the announcement made yesterday.

The Prime Minister was speaking after inaugurating the Badarpur-Faridabad Metro Line at Faridabad.
The Prime Minister regretted that it had become a fashion to politicize every decision taken by the Union Government for the progress of the country.
Asserting that no one should mislead the jawans and the people of the nation, the Prime Minister said that the country would progress not through Raj-neeti (politics), but through Rashtra-neeti (nationalist policies).
The Prime Minister said that a significant proportion of army jawans were from Haryana, and therefore, the announcement of OROP would contribute significantly to Haryana’s economy.
Reiterating that development is the solution to all problems, the Prime Minister said the Union Government is taking all steps for India’s development.
He said the whole world had recently faced economic difficulties, but India’s economy had stood firm.
He added that all State Governments and the Union Government had to move forward shoulder to shoulder.
He reiterated his Government’s resolve for Housing for All by 2022.
The Prime Minister travelled from Central Delhi to Faridabad, and back, by metro.
This will provide a more efficient, flexible and dynamic policy for crude procurement, eventually benefiting the consumers.
The existing policy for import of crude oil was approved by the Cabinet in the year 1979.
In 2001, the Cabinet approved some amendment to the policy.

The scheme will provide an assured pension based on a guaranteed rate of return of 8% per annum for ten years, with an option to opt for pension on a monthly / quarterly / halfyearly and annual basis.
The differential return, i.e., the difference between the return generated by LIC and the assured return of 8% per annum would be borne by Government of India as subsidy on an annual basis.

And, the ASEAN India Plan of Action for the period 2016-2020 has served us well in fulfilling our objectives.
We have already implemented 54 out of 130 activities identified in the Plan of Action.
Enhancing connectivity in all its dimensions- physical, digital, economic, institutional and cultural-is at the heart of India’s strategic partnership with ASEAN.
The threat is local, regional and transnational at the same time.
Our partnership with ASEAN seeks to craft a response that relies on coordination, cooperation and sharing of experiences at multiple levels.
Next year will be a historic milestone in our ties.
We will celebrate 25 years of our Dialogue Partnership, 15 years of our Summit Level interaction and 5 years of our Strategic Partnership.
The celebrations will be launched at an ASEAN-India Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in 2017.
We would also host a Commemorative Summit on the theme “Shared Values, Common Destiny.”
I look forward to working with all of you to make this commemoration a success.

On behalf of the one point three billion people of India, I am delighted to welcome you all to New Delhi.
On the side-lines of this event, I hope the delegates joining us from abroad, shall have some time to see the history and splendour of Delhi.
We are proud to be the global host for World Environment Day, 2018.
As we celebrate this important occasion today, we recall our ancient ethos of universal brotherhood.
This has been expressed in the famous Sanskrit phrase– VasudhaivaKutumbakam – the world is one family.
The same ethos was reflected in the doctrine of trustee-ship, advocated by Mahatma Gandhi.
He had said that ‘Earth provides enough to satisfy everyone’s need, but not enough for everyone’s greed.’
Our traditions have for long stressed the importance of living in harmony with nature.
This is reflected in our reverence of the elements of nature.
It is reflected in our festivals, and in our ancient texts.
India is the fastest growing economy in the world today.
We are committed to raising the standards of living of our people.
We are also committed to ensure, that we do so, in a way that is sustainable and green.
This has freed rural women from the misery of poisonous smoke.
It has also eliminated their dependence on firewood.
We are engaged in a massive push towards renewable energy generation.
We have targeted generation of one hundred and seventy-five GigaWatts of solar and wind energy by 2022.
We are already the fifth largest producer of solar energy in the world.
Not only this, we are also the sixth largest producer of renewable energy.
We are reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
We are switching sources of fuel where possible.
We are transforming cities and public transportation.
We are a young Nation.
To generate employment, we are working towards making India a global manufacturing hub.
We have launched the Make in India campaign.
While doing so, we are laying stress on zero defect and zero effect manufacturing.
This means manufacturing that is without defect, and which does not harm the environment.
As part of the Nationally Determined Contributions, India is committed to reducing thirty-three to thirty-five percent of emission intensity of its GDP during 2005 to 2030.
We are on track to meet the 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution.
We have a robust National Biodiversity Strategy.
With only two point four percent of the world’s land area, India supports seven to eight percent of the recorded species diversity.
At the same time, India supports nearly eighteen percent of human population.
Our tree and forest cover has also increased by one percent in the last two years.
We have also done well in the field of wildlife conservation.
The population of tiger, elephant, lion rhino and other forms of wildlife is on the rise.
We have launched the massive Namami Gange initiative.
This programme, which has already started giving results, will soon revive the Ganga, our most precious river.
India is primarily an agrarian country.
Continued availability of water for agriculture is of importance.
The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana has been launched to ensure that no farm goes without water.
Our motto is ‘More crop, per drop.’
Our experience shows that development can be environment friendly.
It need not come at the cost of our green assets.
World Environment Day seeks to address a very significant challenge this year.
Plastic now threatens to become a menace to humanity.
A lot of it never makes it to the recycling bin.
Worse, a lot of it is non-bio-degradable.
Plastic pollution is already having a deadly impact on our marine ecosystem.
Scientists and fishermen alike have pointed to signs of trouble.
These include declining fish catches, warming ocean temperatures, and vanishing habitats.
Marine litter especially micro-plastic, is a major trans-boundary problem.
Plastic pollution is now entering into our food chain.
In fact, micro plastics have now even entered basic food like salt, bottled water and tap water.
The per capita plastic consumption in India is much lower than in many parts of the developed world.
Our national mission on cleanliness and sanitation – Swachh Bharat Abhiyan – has a special focus on “plastic waste management.”
A short while ago, I visited the Exhibition set up by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.
It showcases some of our success stories.
Among its participants are United Nations, Union and State Governments, industry, and non-government organizations.
I hope they continue to do exemplary work in curbing plastic pollution.
Environmental degradation hurts the poor and vulnerable, the most.
It is the duty of each one of us, to ensure that the quest for material prosperity does not compromise our environment.
As part of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the world had agreed to the theme of “Leave No One Behind.”
This is not possible without ensuring that we all come together to protect what Mother Nature has given us.
This is the Indian way.
And we are happy to share it again with the international community on the auspicious occasion of World Environment Day.
In conclusion, as global host of World Environment Day 2018, I reiterate our commitment to sustainable development.
Let us all join together to beat plastic pollution and make this planet a better place to live.
The choices that we make today, will define our collective future.
The choices may not be easy.

I am delighted to welcome you all to the ASEAN India Commemorative Summit.
Though we are celebrating 25 years of our partnership, our shared voyage goes back thousands of years.
It is a privilege for India to host all the ASEAN Leaders for the second time in five years.
Tomorrow, you will be our honoured Guests at our Republic Day celebrations.
The presence of my brothers and sisters from all our ASEAN partners at this joyous celebration is unprecedented.
Your collective presence here has also touched the hearts of my 1.25 billion fellow Indians.
It highlights the importance of our Strategic Partnership, placing ASEAN at the centre of India’s Act East Policy.
We have organised a Ramayana Festival with troupes from ASEAN countries, to showcase our common cultural treasure through this great epic.
Other major religions, including Buddhism, also bind us closely.
Islam, in many parts of South East Asia has distinctive Indian connections going back several centuries.
We have also jointly released a set of commemorative stamps, to celebrate our common heritage.
Your Majesty, Excellencies,
This objective, in my view, is best served through free and friendly discussion among us.
We have made excellent progress in implementing the objectives of the ASEAN-India Partnership for Peace, Progress and Shared Prosperity, through five year plans of action.
The progress in implementing our third Action Plan for the period 2016-2020 is commendable.
Capacity building projects have been undertaken through the ASEAN-India Cooperation Fund, the ASEAN-India Green Fund, and ASEAN-India Science and Technology Fund.
We remain committed to work with ASEAN to enhance practical cooperation and collaboration in our shared maritime domain.
Humanitarian and Disaster Relief efforts, Security cooperation, and Freedom of Navigation will be key focus areas for our Maritime cooperation.
The Connectivity Summit was also an affirmation of the linkages that India shares with ASEAN through land, air, maritime, cultural, civilizational and people-to-people relations that date back centuries.
Information and Communications Technology will forge new bonds of digital connectivity among us.
These could include new areas of cooperation in a regional high-capacity fiber optic network, and a national rural broadband networks to digitally connect remote areas.
Success of this project could be replicated in other ASEAN countries.
We also offer a training programme on Telecom and Networking Technologies, to share best practices in Policy, Regulation and Technological Development for Information and Communication Technology professionals from ASEAN countries.
In order to deepen our understanding and cooperation in financial matters, I propose a dialogue on digital financial inclusion and investment promotion and infrastructure.
Combating terror financing jointly is yet another important area where we could work collectively.
Our 70 billion dollars trade has grown 25 times over 25 years.
Investments from ASEAN and India are robust and growing.
We will continue to work with ASEAN to further enhance our trade ties, and facilitate interactions among our business community.
The success of recent events like the Business & Investment Meet and Expo, the ASEAN India Business Council Meeting, the Biznet Conference, the Start-up Festival and Hackathon and an ICT Expo have shown encouraging results.
They are warmly accepted in the local community.
Earlier this month, the ASEAN-India Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Singapore recognised their contribution in forging closer ties between us.
India has participated in restoration works to historical structures which attest our enduring civilizational bonds.
It was a privilege for India to play a role in conservation works of temples in Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao PDR and Vietnam.

An important focus of our commemorative events celebrates the power of our youth, our future.
The Youth Summit, the Artist Residency, the Music Festival, and the Start Up Festival for digital commerce among our youth were intended for this.
We have given a boost to their spirit by giving Youth Awards on 24th January.
We would also like to offer dedicated training courses at the Indian Academy of Highway Engineers for ASEAN Highway Professionals.
I also propose that we set up a network of Universities to encourage greater inter-university exchanges.
In conclusion, let me again join my people in expressing our profound appreciation to each one of you for kindly accepting my invitation and for joining us at this Commemorative Summit.
यदिदी ह्येकार (my good friend) Prime Minister Netanyahu
Friends from the Media, I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu and Mrs. Sara Netanyahu for opening their home to me today.
I am most grateful for their warm and generous hospitality.
Just a short while back, I laid a wreath at the Yad Vashem Memorial museum to remember and honour over six million Jewish lives that were lost in the horror of the holocaust.
Yad Vashem tells us that those who believe in humanity and civilized values must come together and defend it at all costs.
As such, we must resolutely oppose the evils of terrorism, radicalism and violence that plague our time.
The link between our people goes back to thousands of years when the first Jews landed on India’s south-western coastline.
Indian Jews are a living and vibrant connect to this shared history.
My visit to Israel celebrates this ancient bond between communities across both our nations.
And, I am happy that I will have occasion to engage with the rich Indian diaspora in Israel later tomorrow.
In modern times, our ties have seen rapid growth since the establishment of our full diplomatic relations a quarter century ago.
Common objectives of economic prosperity, strong technology and innovation ties and the need to secure our societies define the space for convergent action between us.
Over coming decades, we want to frame a relationship that transforms the landscape of our economic engagement.
India is the world’s fastest growing large economy.
We also want to put in place a robust security partnership to respond to shared threats to our peace, stability and prosperity.
I will work with Prime Minister Netenyahu to craft and build a clear action agenda to realise these objectives.
Once again, let me express my sincere gratitude to Prime Minister Netanyahu and Mrs. Netanyahu for their warm welcome.
The Prime Minister appreciated the work done by the Brahma Kumaris institution in many fields, including in solar energy.

He thanked His Highness the Emir of Qatar for his leadership and guidance to the rapid strengthening of bilateral relations, especially in the recent years.
The two leaders discussed the regional situation.
The Prime Minister underscored that terrorism continues to pose serious risk to peace and security in the region and beyond.
He stressed the importance of demonstrable and immediate action by the concerned for putting an end to all forms of terrorism and ending all support to it.
The leaders noted the historic significance of participation of India’s External Affairs Minister as Guest of Honour in the 46th Council of the Foreign Ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Abu Dhabi yesterday.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the passing away of HH Pramukh Swami Maharaj.
His service to society will always be remembered.
HH Pramukh Swami Maharaj was a mentor to me.
I will never forget my interactions with him.

I am very happy to be here for the North Eastern Council Plenary meeting.
I also take this opportunity of welcoming you all to this meeting.
I hope that the deliberations that have already taken place since yesterday and further deliberations that we have today, will help in faster development of this region.
I am also happy to note that the North Eastern Council has provided support in the development of the North East region.
It has been instrumental in establishment of a number of institutions and taking up infrastructure projects in the region.
The North Eastern Council was set up in 1972.
Since then it has contributed to the development of the North East region.
To meet the growing aspirations of the people, it is important that the North Eastern Council introspects and assesses the extent to which it has been able to achieve its objectives.
Perhaps, there is a need to re-orient and upgrade the North Eastern Council.
You may like to consider developing the North Eastern Council as a state-of-the-art resource centre for the North Eastern states with the necessary resources, knowledge and skills.
The North Eastern Council may look into developing a specialised domain expertise either by itself or through an agency model to assist states and central ministries in their development planning as also problem solving needs.
This will enable the imbibing of good governance and best practices in the region.
The North Eastern Council should also consider focussing on issues in emerging areas of livelihood, entrepreneurship, venture funds, start-ups and skill development.
All this will help in generating jobs.
The government has been focussing on the development of the North East region through its pro-active “Act East Policy”.
As part of this policy, we are focussing on reducing the isolation of the region by improving all round connectivity through road, rail, telecom, power and waterways sectors.
If the western region of the country can develop, if other regions of the country can develop, I see no reason why the North East region of the country cannot develop.
I am also convinced that India can move forward if all the regions develop including the North East region.
The North East region is also very important to us for strategic reasons.
And it is my conviction that we have to bring this region at par with the other developed regions of the country.
In the current Budget, more than Rs.30,000 crores have been earmarked for the North East region.
It should be our endeavour to ensure that this money is spent well for the development of the region.
We believe in cooperative and competitive federalism.
States that are strong and want to grow further, need to be given adequate authority and resources.
And States that are not so strong, need to be given needful assistance.
It is in this regard that based on the report of the Committee of Chief Ministers, we have decided to continue to provide assistance in the ratio of 90:10 for core Central schemes and 80:20 for non-core schemes to the North Eastern States.
In the recent past, we have established two important projects in Assam – Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer Limited and Numaligarh Refinery Limited’s wax unit.
These are big projects that would create huge employment opportunities in the North East region.
However, it has taken us many years to complete these projects.
We have to ensure that we are able to complete our projects in time and without cost over-runs.
Only then can we realise the true benefits of these projects.
We are opening up both road and rail routes to our neighbouring countries.
This should give a boost to the economic development of the region.
We have created a specialised highways construction agency for the North East – the “National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation” – that was incorporated on 18th July 2014.
Since then it has set up its Branch Offices, one each in every North Eastern State.
In the road sector, we need to keep in view the special land and weather conditions of this area.
We thus need to be careful in using appropriate technologies in the construction of roads in this area.
We have recently implemented an improved internet connectivity project for the North East region in collaboration with Bangladesh.
This will make available 10 GB of seamless alternate bandwidth for the region.
This integration will benefit the North East region tremendously.
The Government is also making a heavy investment in power transmission projects covering all the eight North Eastern states at a cost of around Rs 10,000 crore.
This would ensure power to more areas.
The railways have undertaken a major expansion in the region at a cost of around Rs 10,000 crore.
In November 2014, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya were put up on the rail map.
Agartala in Tripura has also been connected with broad gauge line.
We are on the way to ensure that all the North East states come on the rail map soon.
In addition, a 132 kilometre part of third alternative connectivity route to North East (that is New Maynaguri – Jogighopa) has also been commissioned.
All the states of the North East region are blessed with natural scenic beauty, distinct historical cultural and ethnic heritage.
All this offers tremendous scope for tourism in the region.
It can also add to the growth and income of the region.
I understand that the Ministry of Tourism has identified a thematic circuit for the North East region.
The North East States must avail facilities and get these BPOs operationalized in their respective States.
This will promote growth and provide jobs to our youth.
The North East is home to exotic fruits, flowers, vegetables, aromatic plants, and herbs.
Most of them are organic in origin.
If we focus our development strategy on organic farming, it would help the region greatly.
A few months ago, I was in Sikkim and participated in a function to declare Sikkim as the first organic state in the country.
The North East can become the organic food basket for this country.
There is a large rural population in the North East region.
If we talk of Assam alone, 86% of the population lives in rural areas.
We have initiated the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Mission to bring in economic, social and basic development of the rural areas in a cluster model.
It should be the endeavour of the region’s states to make use of this mission for the development of the rural areas.
In the end, I would like to express my gratitude to the chairman and all the members of the North Eastern Council for successfully conducting the plenary meeting in Shillong.
My special thanks to the Governor and the Chief Minister of Meghalaya for hosting this meeting.
I am sure that the deliberations in this meeting will go a long way in providing direction to the development of the region.

On this day, a youngster aged 18 years, Khudiram Bose, was sent to the gallows.
It tells us about the struggle for independence and the sacrifices and reminds us of our responsibility towards the nation.
I have had the privilege of working with him for many years.
Be it for a village, for the poor, or for the farmers, he had been providing his inputs all the time while studying these topics very closely.
He was the Urban Development Minister in the Cabinet too.
But I always felt that during the discussions in the cabinet he used to talk more about farmers and the problems of rural areas than the subjects related to urban areas.
This topic was close to his heart probably because of his family background and childhood which was associated with villages.
As Venkaiah ji has taken over the office of the Vice President, it is our responsibility to familiarize the whole world with it.

When the August Kranti was commemorated in its 25th year and 50th year, it was celebrated by the people across the country.
As we commemorate the 75th year of this event today, it indeed a matter of pride for us.
There for I am grateful to the speaker mam for having provided this opportunity.
In the history of our freedom movement, the 9th August movement has been such an important, extensive and intense movement which even the Britishers could not imagine.
Such movement in the history of our nation should be seen as a new inspiration, new energy, new resolve and the spirit of innovation among the people.
India became a free country in 1947.
The period between 1857 to 1957 was a witness to different stages in our freedom movement as many people laid down their lives for the nation and there were several ups and downs.
However, the movement in 1942 was in a way the final mass struggle that the fellow citizens were waiting for.
The 1942 movement prepared the ground work for our independence.
We may recall the freedom struggle movement in 1857 when every corner of the country was reverberating with the call for freedom.
If it’s not for today, it will never happen again; such was the mood of the people of the country.
Thus, every person of this country was involved in this movement.
It seemed that Rajaji’s movement was being carried out through the elite class.
However in 1942, the movement had spread to every region and every social class in the country.
The guiding forces were the words of Gandhi ji.
This was the movements where the slogan of ‘Quit India’ was on everyone’s lips.
I’m not going to be content with anything less than complete independence.
These were Bapu’s words and Bapu also clarified that he had not left the path of non-violence.
However the situation and the pressure was such that even Bapu, had to adapt to the people’s emotions while assuming the leadership.
All sections of the society; the villages, the farmers, the labourers, the teachers, the students joined this movement with the slogan ‘Do or die’.
Bapu even used to say that – ‘whosoever becomes martyr because of the violence perpetrated by the British, one should write this slogan on his body that he was a martyr of this freedom movement’.
I believe that when the country stands united and when there is a power of unity, when the goal is set, the target is set then the people can walk towards that direction.
Within five-years i.e. between 1942 and 1947 Mother India became free.
Every person became a leader and every crossroad became the office of ‘the Do or Die’ movement.
The country put itself inside the oven of revolution.
The flame of revolution was engulfing the country.
Bombay showed the way.
All means of transport were stopped.
The Court proceedings were stalled.
The news of the bravery of the people of India and the brutality of British government was reaching every corner.
The public had well placed the Gandhian mantra of ‘Do or Die’.
In his poem he had said-
Today we have the opportunity in 2017 an enabling situation like that of 1942.
Today we are standing at this juncture, where we can avail the opportunity and how we should take upon this responsibility?
If there are 1.25 crore people in the country, then we can easily progress by bringing the solutions to these problems successfully.
It is true that from 1857 to 1942, we saw that the freedom movement had passed through different stages; there were ups and downs; different turning points, new leadership; sometimes it was violent, then non-violence.
Sometimes there was an atmosphere of confrontation between the two streams, sometimes both the streams complemented each other.
But we have witnessed this whole period from 1857 to 1942 which was incremental in a way.
Gradually growing, slowly spreading, people were slowly connecting.
If we look at the history of the society of the last 100, 200 years, the journey of development was incremental.
We will carry forward our resolve and move forward.
If in the span of 5 years from two thousand Seventeen to Two thousand Twenty Two we take this responsibility to carry India to that height in front of the world then this only is the quest for leadership.
It will be a great service to the nation if the country comes together in this endeavour.
I am confident that we can do a lot of work with consensus on certain issues.
We just saw the GST, and I repeatedly say that this is not my political statement, but my conviction.
The success of GST is not the success of any government; the success of GST is not the success of any party.
The success of GST is the result of the willpower of the people sitting in this House.
GST is a big wonder for the world, if this was possible then more decisions can be easily taken in the future by sitting here.
And as a representative of the 1.25 Crore people, with the resolution of 2022, I believe that we shall continue to bring those results.
Mahatma Gandhi had given the slogan of ‘do or die’; that was the formula of that time.
Together we will give young people more opportunities of self-employment.
Together we will end the problem of malnutrition from the country.
We will all end and eliminate the hindrances that stop women from moving ahead.
Together we will eradicate illiteracy from the country and will continue to do it.
And there may be many issues, but we should keep the mantra ‘do or die’ in our minds.
These resolutions are not of any party or of any government but of 1.25 crore people of the country.
In these five years, from 2017 to 2022, on 75 th year of independence, we should fulfil the dreams of the freedom fighters.
Today, on August Revolution Day, remembering those great men, remembering their sacrifices, penance, and seeking their blessings, let us all get together lead the country by agreeing on a few things – making the country free from all the problems for fulfilment of dreams, power, strength and goal.

We are eradicating poverty, by giving our people the fruits of modern economy, such as universal access to banks and insurance; not just tie them down in endless programmes.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar!
Early this morning, I had an opportunity to spend some time with some young people from Delhi.
And I believe, in the days to come, the spirit and fervor of sports will envelop every young person in the country.
All of us know that in a few days time, the world’s largest sports event, the biggest sports carnival will take place.
RIO is going to resound in our ears time and again.
The entire world will be at play… every country in the world will keep a close watch on the performance of its sportspersons; you too will be doing the same.
All of us harbour a lot of hopes and expectations, but keeping the morale of our sports contingent at RIO high is also the solemn duty of us 1.25 billion countrymen.
In Delhi this morning, the Government of India had organised a very good event, ‘Run for RIO’, ‘Play and Live’, ‘Play and Blossom’.
In the days to come, wherever we are, let us do our bit to encourage our sportspersons.
A sportsperson, who makes it to this stage, does so after putting in a lot of hard work.
Just like 1.25 billion Indians I too as a citizen would like to join you in encouraging them, cheering them up.
A young man Mr. Ankit has reminded me of the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalamji, which was observed last week.
The country, in fact the world paid glowing tributes to him.
The mere mention of Abdul Kalamji’s name brings to mind vivid images of science, technology, missiles – in fact the entire spectrum of strengths and capabilities of India in the days to come.
And that’s why Ankit asks me… What is your government doing to ensure that Abdul Kalamji’s dreams come true?
If you strive to hold it still, it would move beyond your grasp assuming new looks and forms.
If we have to match its strides and move ahead, research and innovation are the keys, these are its lifelines and moving spirit.
In the absence of research and innovation, technology will become a burden, just as still water stagnates and even stinks.
And if we go on just using old technology without recourse to research and innovation, we will become outdated in this rapidly changing world and age.
And that is why the government too has taken steps to attract the new generation toward science and research & innovation in the field of technology.
And that is why I say ‘let us aim to innovate’.
This Mission is being promoted by the Niti Aayog.
If we have to develop the next generation innovators, we shall have to link our children with it.
And that is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of ‘Atal Tinkering Labs’.
Similarly, innovations are directly connected to Incubation Centres.
If we have strong and well-equipped Incubation Centres, a system comes into place for innovations, for start-ups, for experimentation and to bring these efforts to a certain level.
Creation of new Incubation Centres is essential just as it is necessary to strengthen the older Incubation Centres.
And when I talk of Atal Incubation Centres, the government has considered allocating the huge sum of 10 crore rupees for this also.
India is grappling with diverse challenges.
The Government of India wants to specially reward technology developed to find solutions to our problems.
And I am happy that people have evinced interest in these things.
The more the new generation devotes itself to this task, the greater will be their contribution with immense significance for the modern India of the 21st century.
That will be the real tribute to Abdul Kalamji.
If we leave the treatment halfway due to improvement in our condition, we are only helping that bacteria getting more sturdy and difficult to treat.
Microbes spreading TB and malaria are bringing about rapid mutations in themselves, rendering medicines ineffective.
In medical parlance it is called antibiotic resistance.
Hence it is indeed necessary to follow rules in the administration of antibiotics.
The government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance.
You must have seen, these days, on the antibiotic medicine strips there is a red line to make you aware.
You must pay attention to that.
While we are on the subject of health, I would like to talk about one more issue.
It is true that in the last decade there has been a decline in maternal mortality rates but even now, we are not able to save the lives of a large number of pregnant women.
Anemia during or after pregnancy, pregnancy related infections, high BP, any such complication can have devastating effect.
Keeping in view these issues, in the last few months, the Government of India has launched a new campaign ‘Prime Minister Safe Motherhood Campaign’.
I have specially asked the gynecologists whether they could offer their services free on the 9th of every month, for the sake of under privileged mothers!
Can’t my doctor brothers and sisters spare just 12 days in a year for this service to the under privileged?
I do believe that you will indeed do so.
My dear countrymen, today, the whole world is concerned deeply about climate change, global warming and the environment.
These are discussed collectively in the country and across the world.
In India, this has been accorded great importance for centuries.
In the Gita, Bhagwan Shri Krishna says, ‘ashwatth sarvvrikshanam’ which means amongst all trees, I am the Peepal Tree.
He who donates a tree, that tree in return becomes a ladder to salvation just like children.
Therefore it is appropriate that parents desiring their well-being should plant tree and rear them like their own children.
And such experiments are done by many people.
It can easily grow into a people’s movement for planting trees.
I repeatedly tell my farmer brethren that instead of wasting our land in building fences around our fields, why don’t we start planting timber trees there.
Today India has to spend billions and trillions of rupees to import timber wood from abroad for construction of houses and furniture.
Some days ago, a few states taking advantage of this weather have started many campaigns in this direction and the Government of India has also passed CAMPA law, under which about 40 thousand crores rupees will go to the states for planting trees.
I have been told that the Maharashtra government planted about 2 crores sapling in the entire state on 1st July and next year they have taken a pledge to plant about 3 crores trees.
The Maharashtra government has transformed this activity into a people’s movement.
Rajasthan, desert area, has celebrated Van Mahotsav in a very big way and pledged to plant 25 lakhs trees.
To plant 25 lakhs of sapling in Rajasthan is not a small matter!
Those who know the soil conditions of Rajasthan would know how mammoth this task is going to be.
Andhra Pradesh, too has decided to increase its green cover by 50% by the year 2029.
Under the central government’s ongoing ‘Green India Mission’, Railways too have joined in this endeavour.
This year Gujarat has undertaken many projects like ‘Aamra Van’, ‘Ekata Van’ and ‘Shaheed Van’ as a part of Van Mahotsav and launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I am not able to mention every state but all deserve to be appreciated.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa for the first time some time back.
During a foreign visit, diplomacy is practiced, there are trade deliberations, discussions about security and as is customary, many MoUs are concluded.
But for me the visit to South Africa was more like a pilgrimage.
When we think of South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever we hear the words – non-violence, love and forgiveness, the inspiring faces of Gandhi and Mandela appear before us.
During my South Africa tour, I visited Phoenix settlement where Mahatma Gandhi’s home is known as ‘Sarvodaya’.
I also had the good fortune of traveling from Pietermaritzburg station in the train in which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled, and which was the site of the incidence that sowed the seed of the transformation of a Mohandas into Mahatma Gandhi.
The essence of performing one’s duty as explained in Gita was embodied in their persona.
I will remember that meeting forever.
Equality and equal opportunity are the two biggest ‘mantras’ for any society and government.
Equality and equal opportunity, compassion and fraternity, these are the paths leading us to a bright future.
We all want a good future for our children.
Everybody has different needs and different priorities but there is one common path of development, equality, compassion and fraternity.
Come, let us be proud about these Indians who have lived their lives in South Africa embodying our highest and fundamental ideals.
Student from Aligarh had come to meet me.
You should have seen the enthusiasm of those boys and girls.
They had brought a big photo album with them and their faces were lit with joy.
They showed me the pictures of how they had beautified the Aligarh railway station!
These were artistic painting done on the station.
What is more, they had searched for and collected the plastic bottles and oil cans lying in the garbage in the villages and by filling those with soil and planting saplings, they have transformed those pots into a vertical garden.
And by creating this vertical garden on the site of railway station, they have given it a new look.
If you go to Aligarh, do visit the railway station.
I am receiving news from many railway stations in the country where the local populace has taken to depicting on the walls of the railway stations, their area’s identity, through means of their arts.
They have brought about a refreshing feeling.
This is a prime example of the great transformation, which can be brought about through people’s participation.
I felicitate all such citizens involved in these kinds of activities and especially congratulate friends from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, with the onset of rainy season, there is also an onset of festival season in our country.
Think about it, we should gift such a present to our sisters, which really provides her security in future.
And this is what social security in reality is all about; this is the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
We are enjoying our independence and are proud to be free citizens, but this is an occasion to remember those who sacrificed their all for winning our independence.
The 75th year of Quit India and 70th year of Independence can be source of new inspiration, source of new enthusiasm and an occasion to take a pledge to do something for our nation.
The whole nation should be imbued with the spirit of those great patriots and we should once again experience anew the fragrance of freedom.
I hope that you too become inspired with the spirit of patriotism and do something good in that vein.
Do send a picture of it on ‘Narendra Modi app.
Let us create such an atmosphere in the nation.
You too must be having certain thoughts that you wish were proclaimed from Red Fort.
I invite you to write to me about your thoughts that I, as your representative, as your Pradhan Sevak should talk about from the Red Fort.
Send me suggestions, your advice and new thoughts, I will try to convey your thoughts to rest of the countrymen.
I do not wish that whatever I speak from the ramparts of Red Fort should just be the opinion of the Prime Minister; it should be the collective voice of 125 crores countrymen.

Moreover, Iran has endorsed the status of India as a true leader in the field of Traditional Systems of Medicine backed by huge and strong infrastructure and “State of the Art” production units.
Excellency, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,
Excellency, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam,
Honourable Ministers,
Thank you for the honour and privilege of delivering the Singapore Lecture.
We have been on the road together in the past few weeks – for the G20 and the ASEAN and East Asia Summits.
This tells you how deeply linked the destinies of our two nations are .
To the people of Singapore, on 50 years of Independence, I extend the greetings and the good wishes of 1.25 billion friends and admirers.
In the life of humans and nations, milestones of time are natural.
But, few countries can celebrate the first fifty years of existence with a sense of pride and satisfaction that Singapore deserves to.
And, I can do no better than to begin with homage to one of the tallest leaders of our time and the architect of modern Singapore – Lee Kuan Yew.
To capture his mission in own words, he gave his life to see a successful Singapore.
And, it was with his well known steely determination that he saw Singapore through to its golden jubilee year.
His impact was global.
He believed in India’s potential at home and her role abroad more than many in India.
For me, he was a personal inspiration.
From his Singapore Stories, I drew many lessons.
And, that it was as important to keep your city and surroundings clean as it was to build modern infrastructure.
For me, too, in India, the Swachh Bharat campaign, is not just a programme to clean our environment, but to transform the way we think, live and work.
For quality, efficiency, and productivity are not just technical measures, but also a state of mind and a way of life.
So, in my visit to Singapore this March and in the observance of a day’s mourning in India, we wanted to honour a true friend and a very special relationship.
Singapore is a Nation that has become a metaphor for the reality of dreams.
Singapore teaches us many things.
The size of a Nation is no barrier to the scale of its achievements.
And, the lack of resources is no constraint for inspiration, imagination, and innovation.
When a Nation embraces diversity, it can unite behind a common purpose.
Singapore has done more than just lift a nation into the highest levels of prosperity within a generation.
It has inspired this region’s progress and led in its integration.
It is based on what I believe is the key to success: the quality of human resources, the belief of a people and the resolve of a Nation.
It is with the same vision that we are pursuing the transformation of India.
I do not judge the success of our efforts from the cold statistics of number, but from the warm glow of smile on human faces.
So, one set of our policies are to empower our people.
Together with this software of change, we are also building the hardware of progress – next generation infrastructure, revived manufacturing, improved agriculture, easier trade and smarter services.
India and Singapore have been together at many crossroads of time.
Our relationship is written in the pages of history, the footprints of culture, the ties of kinship and the old connection of commerce.
Singapore’s success became an aspiration of Indians.
And, in turn, India became the hope for a more peaceful, balanced and stable world.
No one worked harder for it and no one deserves more credit for it than Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.
He re-connected India to Singapore and the region.
He also opened my eyes to its vast prospects.
Today, Singapore is one of our most important partners in the world.
It is a relationship that is as strategic as it is wide-ranging.
We have comprehensive defence and security relations.
It flows out of shared interests and a common vision.
Singapore holds regular exercises with and in India.
Starting from the first IT Park in Bengaluru, it now includes the newest state capital in India, Amravati in Andhra Pradesh.
Our partnership will expand as our economies grow and the framework of trade and investment improves further.
But, I have always seen Singapore in loftier terms.
And, in many ways, Singapore will also influence the course of our region in this century.
Mr. Prime Minister, Distinguished members,
This area covers the arc of Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean Regions.
However we choose to define it, the underlining theme of connected histories and interconnected destinies stand out clearly.
This is a region of expanding freedom and prosperity.
From the darkness of the middle of the last century, Japan led Asia’s rise.
It is a journey that must succeed.
And, Singapore and India must work together to realize it.
India’s history has been inseparable from Asia.
There were times when we turned inwards.
And, in the course of last eighteen months, my government has engaged more with this region than any other in the world.
From a new opening with Pacific Island Nations, Australia and Mongolia to more intense engagement with China, Japan, Korea and ASEAN members, we have pursued our vision with purpose and vigour.
India and China share a boundary and five millennia of continuous engagement.
Monks and merchants have nurtured our ties and enriched our societies.
China’s economic transformation is an inspiration for us.
And, as it rebalances its economy, and as India steps up the pace of its growth, we can both reinforce each other’s progress.
And, we can advance stability and prosperity in our region.
And, together, we can be more effective in addressing our common global challenges, from trade to climate change.
And, we have agreed to strengthen strategic communication and expand convergences.
We explore shared economic opportunities while addressing common threats like terrorism.
India and Japan may have discovered each other somewhat later.
But, my friend, Prime Minister Abe, showed me in the magnificent shrines of Kyoto the symbols of our much longer spiritual engagement.
Independent India took that advice seriously.
There are few partnerships that enjoy so much goodwill in India as our relations with Japan.
And, no partner is likely to play as big a role in India’s transformation as Japan.
We do more together now.
We see this as a strategic partnership that is vital for securing a peaceful and stable Asia, Pacific and Indian Ocean Regions.
With almost the entire region, India has frameworks of economic cooperation.
We want to be more deeply integrated with the regional economy.
And, we will upgrade our partnership agreements and work for an early conclusion of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.
In the flux and transition of our times, the most critical need in this region is to uphold and strengthen the rules and norms that must define our collective behaviour.
India will lend its strength to keep the seas safe, secure and free for the benefit of all.
We must also do so because our pressing challenges are not from one another, but common to each of us.
There will be political, legal, military and intelligence efforts.
But, we must do more.
Countries also must be held accountable for sanctuaries, support, arms and funds.
Nations must cooperate more with each other.
Societies must reach out within and to each other.
This is especially important for our region, particularly the small island states.
Ours is a region of enormous promise.
But, we know that enduring peace and prosperity are not inevitable.
So, we must work hard to realize our vision of an Asian Century.
Asia has the wisdom of its ancient cultures and all the great religions of the world.
It also has the energy and drive of youth.

India stands firmly with our sisters & brothers of Bangladesh in this hour of grief.
My thoughts are with the bereaved families.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the signing of the Tripartite Agreement among India, Brazil and South Africa (IBSA), on the IBSA Fund for the Alleviation of Poverty and Hunger.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, delivered an address in the Lok Sabha, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement.
The Prime Minister noted that the freedom struggle went through several phases, and recalled various leaders and movements that emerged at various points since 1857.
He added that the Quit India Movement that began in 1942, was a decisive movement.
Quoting Gandhiji, the Prime Minister said that all sections of people joined in, responding to Mahatma Gandhi’s clarion call of “Do or Die.”
He said that from political leaders to the common man, everyone was imbued with this spirit.
The Prime Minister quoted the writer Ramvriksha Benipuri, and the poet Sohanlal Dwivedi to describe the mood that prevailed at that time.
The Prime Minister noted that corruption, poverty, illiteracy and malnutrition are challenges that India now needs to overcome.
He said that a positive transformation, and a common resolve is required for this.
In 1942, conditions internationally became favourable for India to get independence, the Prime Minister said, noting that today again, the global conditions are favourable for India.
He said, that from 1857 to 1942, the move towards freedom was incremental, but the years from 1942 to 1947, were transformative, and delivered on the objective.
He said that the next five years should also be about “Sankalp se Siddhi” – a resolve which will lead us to accomplishment.
All the dignitaries present here on the dais and all my friends present in this beautiful ground, I convey my best wishes on the fourth International Day for Yoga to Yoga lovers all over the world from this holy land of Devbhumi Uttarakhand.
Even otherwise, Uttarakhand has been the main centre for Yoga for several decades.
These mountains of Uttarakhand spontaneously inspire us for Yoga and Ayurveda.
Even a common man gets a unique diving feeling when he visits this place.
There is an incredible spirit, vibrations and magnetic power in this holy land.
It’s a matter of pride for all Indians that today as the rising sun will progress on its journey, as the sunrays will reach the earth and light is spread, in all those places people will welcome the sun with Yoga.
From Dehradun to Dublin, from Shanghai to Chicago, from Jakarta to Johannesburg, everywhere, there is Yoga all around.
Whether it is thousands of feet high mountains of Himalaya or be it desert area singed by sunlight, Yoga is flourishing the life in every situation.
Yoga helps to maintain balance amidst this disintegration.
It does the job of uniting us.
Yoga brings about peace in this modern fast paced life by combining the body, mind, spirit and soul.
It brings about peace in the family by uniting the person with the family.
It brings about a harmony in the society by making the family sensitive towards society.
Societies become the links for national integration.
And this kind of countries bring about peace and harmony in the world.
And humanity flourishes and gainstrength from this feeling of brotherhood.
And this was the first such proposal in the history of United Nations which was approved in the least time.
If we start taking pride in our legacy and if we abandon those things which are out of sync with the time, and that kind of thing doesn’t last either.
But if we don’t have any trust in our own strength and capabilities then no one will accept it.
If a family itself continues to demoralise a child in the family and if that family expects that the kid will be respected in the locality then it is not possible.
When parents, when family, when brothers and sisters, all of them accept a child as it is only then the neighbours also start accepting the child.
Today, Yoga has become one of the most powerful unifying forces in the world.
I can say it with full sense of confidence that today if we gather the number of people doing Yoga in the entire world then incredible facts will be revealed to the world.
People gathering for Yoga, people like you gathering for Yoga in different countries, in parks, in open grounds, on the sides of the roads, in offices and homes, in hospitals, in schools and colleges, in the historic buildings, have been providing further energy to the feeling of this universal brotherhood and global friendship.
Infact, Yoga Day has become one of the biggest mass movements in the quest for good health and well-being.
Friends, from Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, Yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions.
Yoga is beautiful because it is ancient yet modern…it is constant yet evolving.
In Yoga, we have the perfect solution to the problems we face, either as individuals or in our society.
Ours is a world that never sleeps.
At every given point, there is something happening in a different part of the world.
A fast-paced existence brings with it lot of stress.
I was shocked to read that every year, almost 18 million people all over the world die due to heart-related diseases.
About 1.6 million people lose the fight against diabetes.
The way to lead a calm, creative and content life is Yoga.
It can show the way in defeating tensions and mindless anxiety.
Instead of dividing, Yoga always unites.
Instead of further animosity, Yoga assimilates.
Instead of increasing suffering, Yoga heals.
Practicing Yoga has the ability to herald an era of peace, happiness and brotherhood.
I urge you all to build on this momentum in the times to come.
This can be the enduring impact of this day.
Friends, Yoga has shown the path of wellness to the world from the path of illness.
This is the reason because of which the acceptance for Yoga throughout the world has been increasing so rapidly.
It has revealed in the studies conducted by Coventry University and Radboud University that Yoga not only provides relief to our bodies but it can also reverse those molecular reactions taking place in our DNA that cause illness and depression.
We can protect ourselves from several diseases in addition to having a good heath if we daily practice the poses and breathing exercise of Yoga.
Regular practice of Yoga has a direct bearing on the medical expenses of any family.
Friends, the increasing spread of Yoga has brought the world to India and India to the world even closer.
The position that Yoga has got in the world due to constant efforts made by us that position will be further strengthened with the time.
It is our responsibility to further develop the understanding about Yoga for a healthy and happy humanity.
I convey my sincere regards to the government of Uttarakhand for organising this event.
Thank you very much.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the demise of Former President of Singapore Mr. S.R.Nathan.
“Saddened by the demise of former Singapore President SR Nathan.
Singapore has lost a distinguished leader who was widely admired.
We in India join the people of Singapore in deeply mourning the passing away of former President Nathan.
Your Excellency Prime Minister Dato’ Sri Mohammad Najib,
Your Majesty,
Prime Minister Najib and the people of Malaysia deserve our deepest appreciation for outstanding arrangements for the Summits in this beautiful city of Kuala Lumpur.
And, I congratulate you for your excellent review of the processes of East Asia Summit.
This is a historic summit.
We applaud the ASEAN members for realizing the vision of the ASEAN Community and charting the path to 2025.
We expect ASEAN to continue to play a leading and central role in realizing the vision of broader regional integration and cooperation.
In this forum, we often thought of terrorism as a peripheral problem for this region.
We are also days away from the summit on climate change in Paris.
There, we must not only come together to craft a balanced and concrete outcome on climate change.
But we must also stand together to send a clear message that we will not retreat in the face of terror.
Since my government entered office 18 months ago, no region has seen greater engagement from India than the Asia Pacific and the Indian Ocean Region.
This reflects a long standing national consensus in India on the importance of this region for India and the world.
The world still looks to the region to address our global challenges and uncertainties.
Yet, our region is also navigating its way through multiple transitions to a stable, peaceful and prosperous future.
The East Asia Summit is the key forum for shaping the collective future of the region.
First, East Asia Summit must continue to support the evolution of an inclusive, balanced, transparent and open regional architecture for security and cooperation.
We must deepen our collective commitment to strengthen and abide by international rules and norms.
Second, the oceans remain the pathway to our prosperity and security.
Territorial disputes must be settled through peaceful means.
India and Bangladesh recently settled their maritime boundary using the mechanism of UNCLOS.
Parties must also redouble efforts for early adoption of a Code of Conduct on the basis of consensus.
Third, we need stronger commitment and closer cooperation on cyber security.
We will also have to work on certain norms of behavior in this area.
Outer space is also emerging as a major area of security concern.
We must also continue to strengthen cooperation on non-proliferation.
India shares both land and maritime boundaries with ASEAN.
India will continue to deepen bilateral security partnerships in ASEAN and with other EAS partners.
We will remain active participants in the ASEAN-led security dialogue and cooperation forums.
Four, We must also work towards early conclusion of a balanced and broad-based Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
Trans Pacific Partnership is also a major development.
These, I hope, will eventually not become competing regimes, but the foundations of an integrated economic community in the region.
Finally, development cooperation is at the heart of the East Asia Summit.
India will continue to support the efforts of our partner countries.
And, we are taking the lead in establishing EAS Virtual Knowledge Portals on Disaster Management and Trauma Care & Nursing.
The Nalanda University is shaping up as a world class centre of knowledge and learning.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the MoU between India and Afghanistan on cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space.
The MoU envisages cooperation between the two countries for application of space technologies in education, agriculture, weather forecasting, telecommunications, rural health, sanitation, urban development, resource mapping navigation, remote sensing and any other areas mutually agreed upon.
The MoU will benefit both countries in the following manner:
The projects reviewed today, include the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor, and construction of four new AIIMS at Manglagiri in Andhra Pradesh, Kalyani in West Bengal, Nagpur in Maharashtra, and Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh.
The Prime Minister also reviewed the progress of the Smart Cities Mission.
He appreciated the participation of cities in the challenge route.
Reviewing the progress of the Forest Rights Act, the Prime Minister emphasized the importance of using space technology to determine the rights of tribal communities, and settle claims expeditiously.
In his remarks on the occasion, the Prime Minister laid stress on the importance of innovation and technology for the progress and development of the nation.
He said institutions of higher education should give primacy to innovation in learning.
He said finding solutions to challenges like global warming and converting waste to wealth, were key to rise of India.
He exhorted institutions of higher learning to focus on areas such as defence manufacturing.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved conferment of Central Group ‘A’ Service and Cadre.
Review of Group ‘A’ Executive Officers of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) with net creation of 19 posts of various ranks from Assistant Commandant to Inspector General ranks to enhance the operational and administrative capabilities of SSB.
Increase of existing structure of Group ‘A’ posts from 1253 to 1272 posts are as follows:

Union Minister for Science & Technology, and Earth Sciences, Dr. Harsh Vardhan
Union Minister of State for Science & Technology, and Earth Sciences, Shri Y. S. Chowdary
General President of the Indian Science Congress Association, Professor D. Narayana Rao
Vice Chancellor of Sri Venkateswara University, Professor A. Damodaram
I am delighted to begin the New Year with distinguished scientists from home and abroad in the holy city of Tirupati.
I am happy to inaugurate this 104th session of The Indian Science Congress in the panoramic campus of Sri Venkateswara University.
And I appreciate the Indian Science Congress Association for choosing an appropriate theme “Science & Technology for National Development” for this year’s session.
The nation will always be grateful to the scientists who have worked tirelessly to empower our society by their vision, labour, and leadership.
In November 2016, the country lost one such eminent scientist and institution builder, Dr. M.G.K. Menon.
I join you in paying tribute to him.
The speed and scale of changes we encounter today are unprecedented.
How are we going to respond to these challenges that we do not even know could arise?
It is a deep-rooted curiosity-driven scientific tradition which allows quick adaptation to new realities.
Tomorrow’s experts will come from investments we make today in our people and infrastructure.
Some of these important challenges are in the key sectors of clean water & energy, food, environment, climate, security, and healthcare.
We equally need to keep an eye on the rise of disruptive technologies and be prepared to leverage them for growth.
We need to clearly assess the challenges and opportunities for our technology readiness and competitiveness.
I have been told that the Technology Vision 2035 document released in last year’s Science Congress, is now developing into a detailed roadmap for twelve key technology sectors.
Further, NITI Aayog is evolving a holistic science and technology vision for the country.
One important area that needs to be addressed is the rapid global rise of Cyber-Physical Systems.
This has the potential to pose unprecedented challenges and stresses to our demographic dividend.
But we can turn it into a huge opportunity by research, training and skilling in robotics, artificial intelligence, digital manufacturing, big data analysis, deep learning, quantum communication and Internet-of-Things.
There is a need to develop and exploit these technologies in services and manufacturing sectors; in agriculture, water, energy & traffic management; health, environment, infrastructure and Geo Information Systems; security; financial systems and in combating crime.
The oceans that surround the Indian peninsula have over thirteen hundred of our islands.
They contain enormous opportunities in energy, food, medicine and a host of other natural resources.
The ocean economy should be a significant dimension of our sustainable future.
I am told, that the Ministry of Earth Sciences is working to launch a Deep Ocean Mission to explore, understand and harness this resource in a responsible way.
This could be a transformative step for the prosperity and security of the nation.
Our best science and technology institutions should further strengthen their basic research in line with leading global standards.
Translating this basic knowledge into innovations, start-ups and industry will help us achieve inclusive and sustainable growth.
I am sure that our scientists will further meet the challenges of enhanced quality of basic research, its technology translation and its societal connect.
The wheels we set in motion today will achieve this goal.
Science must meet the rising aspirations of our people.
India fully appreciates the strong role science and technology plays in meeting the societal needs.
We must address the problems of urban-rural divide and work for inclusive development, economic growth and employment generation.
To enable this, there is a need for a new overarching structure that will coordinate with all the relevant stakeholders.
Our ministries, our scientists, R&D institutions, industries, start-ups, universities and IITs, all should work together seamlessly.
In particular, our infrastructure and socio-economic ministries must make appropriate use of science and technology.
Our Institutions could consider inviting outstanding scientists from abroad including NRIs for long term research associations.
We should involve foreign and NRI PhD students in post-doctoral research in our projects.
Another empowering factor for scientific delivery is the Ease of Doing Science.
If we want science to deliver, we must not constrain it.
We need to address the problems of ease of access, maintenance, redundancy and duplication of expensive equipments in our Scientific Institutions.
We must create an environment for sharing of ideas and resources.
The brightest and best in every corner of India should have the opportunity to excel in science.
This will ensure that our youth get high-end training exposure to the best of science and technology to make them job-ready in a competitive world.
To this end, I would exhort the National Laboratories to connect with schools and colleges to develop appropriate training programs.
This will also help with the effective use and maintenance of our vast scientific and technological infrastructure.
Laboratories, Research Institutions and Universities in each major city region, should be interlinked to function on a hub and spoke model.
The hubs will share major infrastructure, drive our national science missions and be the engines that link discovery to application.
College teachers with background in research can be connected to the neighbouring universities and R&D institutions.
Outreach activities from the institutions of eminence to schools, colleges and polytechnics will activate the latent Science and Technology manpower from the educational institutions in your neighbourhoods.
As a step in this direction, Ministry of Science & Technology is initiating a programme focused on students of classes 6 to 10.
These technologies should aim to convert agri and bio-waste to satisfy multiple needs of electricity, clean water, crop-processing and cold storage.
The role of science in planning, decision making, and governance has never been more important.
We need to develop and deploy Geo-information Systems to meet the development goals of our citizens, Gram Panchayats, Districts and States.
A coordinated effort by the Survey of India, ISRO and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology can be transformative.
For sustainable development, we must take strong measures to focus on Waste to Wealth Management in the critical areas of electronic waste, biomedical and plastic wastes, and solid waste and waste water solutions.
We are scaling up R&D on clean carbon technologies, technologies for enhancement of energy efficiency and increased and efficient use of renewable energy.
Science and technology is a key factor in the Startup India Programme launched in January 2016.
Two other strong initiatives are Atal Innovation Mission and NIDHI – the National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations.
These programmes focus on building an innovation driven enterprise ecosystem.
Further, Public-Private partnerships with CII, FICCI and high technology private companies are being pursued to strengthen the innovation ecosystem.
Our Scientists have contributed strongly to the strategic vision of the nation.
The Indian space programme has put India among the top space faring nations.
We have achieved a high degree of self-sufficiency in space technology, including launch vehicle development, payload and satellite building, applications for development and the building of core competence and capacity.
The Defence Research & Development Organisation has played the role of a force multiplier for the Armed Forces with its systems and technologies.
We are leveraging strategic international partnerships and collaborations based on the principles of mutuality, parity and reciprocity, to make Indian Science globally competitive.
We are also placing special emphasis on building strong relationships with our neighbouring countries and multilateral fora such as BRICS.
The best of global science is helping us unravel creation’s mysteries and develop cutting-edge technologies.
In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that the Government remains committed to provide the best support to our Scientists and Scientific Institutions.
I am sure that our scientists will scale up their efforts ranging from the quality of basic sciences to technology development to innovation.
Together, we will prevail to make a just, equitable and prosperous nation.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today presented the National Bravery Awards to 18 children.
Three of these awards were presented posthumously.
The Prime Minister remarked that most of the awardees are from rural and humble backgrounds.
Shri Narendra Modi said that after such recognition, future expectations from the awardees become higher than usual.
He wished them well in their future endeavours.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today released two commemorative coins, as part of the 125th birth anniversary year celebrations of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar.
The coins, which are of “ten-rupee” and “one hundred and twenty-five rupee” denomination, were issued on the Mahaparinirvan Divas of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that there were only a few individuals who remain alive in public consciousness, even 60 years after their death.
He said the more we recall Dr. Ambedkar’s thought, in the context of issues currently faced by India, the more we come to respect his vision and his approach to inclusiveness.
The Prime Minister appreciated Dr. Ambedkar’s vision on subjects such as women empowerment, India’s federal structure, finance and education.
My heartiest greetings to countrymen on this pious, festive occasion.
We have seen how closely the power of ‘Ram Naam’, the chant of Lord Ram’s name, permeated every moment of revered Bapu’s life.
A while ago, when distinguished dignitaries of all ASEAN Countries were here on the 26th of January, they were accompanied by cultural troupes from their respective countries.
And it’s a matter of immense pride that a majority of these countries presented the Ramayan in front of us.
This signifies that Ram & Ramayan continues to inspire and have a positive impact, not just in India, but in that part of the world too.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ramnavami.
My dear countrymen, just like every time earlier, I have received a rather large number of letters, e mails, phone calls and comments from you.
I read a post written on MyGov by Komal Thakkar ji, where she has referred to starting on-line courses for Sanskrit.
Alongwith being IT professional, your love for Sanskrit has gladdened me.
I have instructed the concerned department to convey to you efforts being made in this direction.
I shall also request listeners of Mann Ki Baat who are engaged in the field of Sanskrit, to ponder over ways & means to take Komalji’s suggestion forward.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji of Village Baraakar, District Nalanda, Bihar – I read your comments written on the Narendra Modi App.
The concerns you have raised on the depleting ground water levels is indeed of great importance.
You have urged one and all to retain and keep aside some water for birds & animals, during summer time.
Sakal ji, I have conveyed your sentiments to our listeners.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresha Ji has asked me to speak to the youth concerning their health.
He feels that our youth are physically weak, compared to those of other Asian countries.
And it is his heart felt desire to see all those photos & videos being shared on social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India has already done that on social media and the Narendra Modi App, beginning that very day.
You may now like them, re-tweet them, post them to your friends.
Anagha, Jayesh and many other children from Chennai have written & posted to me their heartfelt thoughts on the gratitude cards, the post script to the book ‘Exam Warriors’.
Let me tell Anagha, Jayesh & other children that these letters enliven me up after a hard day’s work.
Our farmer brothers & sisters have written on Kisan Melas, Farmer Carnivals and activities revolving around farming, being held across the country.
Quite a few active citizens have sent in suggestions on the subject of water conservation.
Ever since we have begun conversing with each other in ‘Mann Ki Baat’ through the medium of radio, I have noticed a pattern that in the sweltering heat of this season, most letters focus around topic pertaining to summer time.
Just before examinations, letter pour in, touching on the anxieties of our young student friends who are about to appear.
During the festival season, our festivals, our culture, our traditions are focused upon.
In a way, this is endowed with the might to transform the entire season-cycle of the country.
When I get to read in your letters how a rickshaw puller from Karimgunj in Assam, Ahmed Ali, has built nine schools for underprivileged children, I witness firsthand the indomitable will-power this country possesses.
When I heard the story of Kanpur based Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhary, of how he visits the underprivileged on footpaths and offers free medicines to them, it gives one an opportunity to feel the sense of brotherhood that prevails in the country.
Thirteen years ago, on account of a delay in medical treatment, a Cab driver from Kolkata, Saidul Laskar lost his sister.
He vowed to construct a hospital in order to ensure that none of the underprivileged face a similar situation due to lack of medical aid.
A young engineer girl donated her first salary for this noble cause.
Innumerable shining examples like these are the hallmark of our country.
Today the whole world has changed the way it looks at India.
The name ‘India’ now evokes a sense of awe & respect; the reason behind it is the ‘Purusharth’, the resolute yet selfless inner strength of such illustrious sons & daughters of Mother India.
An atmosphere of positivity built on a self confidence filled with hope has pervaded all over.
This self confidence, this very positivity will by a catalyst in realising our resolve of New India, of making our dream come true.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very crucial for our farming brothers and sisters.
That is why a large number of letters on agriculture have been received.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji, Chaudhari Devi Lal ji – they all recognized agriculture and the farmer as vital aspects of the nation’s economy and also for the common man’s life.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastriji generally insisted on conservation of trees, plants and vegetation and also highlighted the importance of an improvised agricultural infrastructure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lal ji had talked of creating a mass awakening on an extensive scale about the necessary measures to ensure a better income for our farmers and provide better irrigation facilities and to increase food and milk production.
Chaudhari Charan Singh in his speech in 1979 had urged our farmers to use new technology and to adopt new innovations and underlined their vital significance.
I recently visited the Krishi Unnati Mela organized in New Delhi.
This state has a small area but it has attained a grand success.
Our farmers in Meghalaya, in the year 2015-16, achieved record production as compared to the last five years.
They have showed that if once the targets are set, spirits are high and with a strong resolve, the set targets can most certainly be attained.
Today, the farmers have technology to help them while they work hard in their fields.
This has provided a big boost to our agro- producers.
I have received a number of letters in which a large number of farmers have written about MSP and they wanted that I should talk to them at length over this.
Brothers and sisters, in this year’s budget a big decision has been taken to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce.
It has been decided that the MSP of notified crops will be fixed at least one and a half times of their cost.
Moreover, an extensive exercise on agricultural reforms is being undertaken across the country in order to ensure that our farmers get a fair price for their crop.
Efforts are on to connect local village mandis to wholesale market and then on with the global market.
Twenty- two thousand rural haats in the country will be upgraded by creating the necessary infrastructure and these will be integrated with APMC and e-NAM platform- so that the farmers would not have to go to distant places for selling their produce.
In other words, such a system is being set up where in farms in any part of the country will have a market-connect.
How should the country celebrate it?

In the health sector the nation has now moved ahead from the conventional approach.
Earlier, every aspect regarding health used to be a responsibility of the Health Ministry alone.
Preventive health care is the least costly and the easiest one as well.
And, the more we become aware about preventive health care, the more beneficial will it be for the individuals, the family and the society.
The first necessity for a healthy life is cleanliness.
Also, extensive work is going on to set up Health Wellness Centres across the country.
Yoga has attained worldwide recognition as a measure of preventive health care.
Yoga is a guarantee of both fitness and wellness.
It is the result of our concerted efforts and commitment that Yoga has now become a mass movement and reached every house.
Less than a hundred days are now left for the International Yoga Day on 21st June.
On the previous three International Yoga Days, people in our country and people all over the world participated with great zeal and enthusiasm.
This time too, we need to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and motivate our family, friends and all others from now itself to do yoga.
Yoga has to be made popular among the youth, the senior citizens, men and women from all age groups through interesting ways.
Usually, the country’s Television and electronic media do a variety of programmes on Yoga the whole year.
Can we, beginning now, till the Yoga Day, devise a campaign to spread awareness on Yoga?
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
I will share these videos with you so that we may do aasans and pranayam together.
Efforts are being extensively undertaken to make health care accessible and affordable, make it easily accessible and affordable for the common man.

My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of India’s industrialization.

New seaports are being constructed on a number of seaways of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
In the era of 40s, while most of the discussions were centred around the Second World War, the looming Cold war and the partition –it was during those times Dr. Ambedkar had laid the foundation of Team India’s spirit in a way.
He had talked about the importance of federalism, federal system and stressed on Center and states working together for the upliftment of the country.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar from April 14 to May 5 ‘Gram-Swaraj Abhiyan,’ is being organized.
Under the aegis of this campaign, separate programmes on village development, poverty amelioration and social justice will be held throughout India.
I urge you all to be a part of this campaign.
My dear countrymen, a spectrum of many festivals would dawn upon us in the next few days- Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and the Baisakhi.
The day of Bhagwan Mahavir’s birth anniversary is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavirji, the apostle of non-violence will inspire us all.
I extend felicitations to all on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti.
The very mention of Easter reminds us of the inspirational preaching of Lord Jesus Christ which has always impressed on mankind the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion.
Once again, my best wishes to you all on the occasion of the festivals coming our way.

West Bengal and Kolkata have to develop, for their own sake, and for the benefit of the region.
That is why we have the “Act East” policy.
The region has talented people and a lot of resources.
The Prime Minister stated that he is fully committed for West Bengal’s and Kolkata’s development.
It is with this in view that the Central Government has agreed to devolve 42% of the divisible pool of taxes to states for the next five years.
In addition, the Central Government has accepted other recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission relating to Revenue Deficit Grants and other Grants.
Among the large states, West Bengal is one the most important beneficiaries of this decision.
b. West Bengal’s share of taxes has been increased from 7.264% to 7.324%.
c. Most importantly, West Bengal is getting a Revenue Deficit Grant of Rs. 8,449 crore in 2015-16 and a total Revenue Deficit Grant of Rs. 11,760 crore.
The only other non-special category states getting this grant are Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.

It was Rs 25,340 crore in 2014-15 and is estimated to be Rs. 38,461 crore in 2015-16
f. West Bengal is getting a Revenue Deficit Grant of Rs. 8,449 crore in 2015-16.
There are also grants to Local Bodies which have almost doubled.
g. If all these transfers are put together, on a year to year basis, the increase in resources to West Bengal will be Rs. 22,000 crores in 2015-16 compared to 2014-15, an increase of 80%.
On the problem of debt, the Prime Minister said that you have inherited a large burden.
We too have inherited a large burden.
The Centre and States have to collectively find a solution to this.
In any case, the 14th Finance Commission has taken into account the interest burden on states and has fully compensated the revenue deficit arising as a result of this.
This is why West Bengal is getting an additional Revenue Deficit Grant along with only two other non-Special Category States.
Therefore, interest burden should not affect development activities any more in future.
The additional financial resources being made available by the Central Government from the current fiscal onwards will substantially improve the position of the State to discharge interest liability and free up funds for developmental activities to boost growth.
The Prime Minister also pointed out that, the Union Government has decided to give West Bengal the royalty on coal and other minerals.
This will provide a benefit of ~ Rs. 1,600 crore to the state annually.
In addition, West Bengal will get Rs. 11,200 crore from the coal blocks that have been auctioned so far and there will even more revenue in future.
In this scenario, West Bengal is better placed as compared to the past and has adequate funds to meet its development needs fully.

I have returned from Aligarh, just a little while ago.
It is a great pleasure for me to have an opportunity today to get your blessings.
I welcome all Acharyas, Saints for spreading the messages of Sant Sri Madhavacharya for moral and spiritual upliftment of human being.
I also salute the holy land of Karnataka, where saint like Madhavacharya emerged in one hand and in other hand spiritual souls like Acharya Shankar and Acharya Ramanuj gave it special affection.
Udupi has been Sri Madhavacharya Ji’s birth place and work place also.

Sri Madhavacharya was also the founder of the Krishna Temple here.
I have special relationship with the Krishna idol installed in this temple.
I have special attachment with Udupi.

Our country’s history is thousands years old.
Motivated by thousands years old history, our country has been witnessing changes from time to time.
There have been changes among people and society.
But, sometimes, some evils find their place in society several times.
Our society has such characteristic that whenever any evil emerges, somebody from the society itself, start reformatory works.
There was such a period also, when its leadership was in the hands of Saints of the country.
This is unique capability of the Indian society that we have been blessed with such god-like great men from time to time, who identified these evils and shown the path for liberation.
There are several examples, when he had expressed his views against the evils and shown the society a new direction.
The social reforms to end the evil of animal slaughter during Yajnasis also a gift from saints like Sri Madhavacharya.
This Bhakti Aandolan had reached north India from south India via Maharashtra and Gujarat.
In that Bhakti Yuga, in that period, our saints had come out of Temples and Mutts and had moved across every part of India, whether it is east, west, north or south or areas associated with any language, they tried to bring awareness and made efforts to awaken the soul of India.
In south- Madhavacharya, Nimbakacharya, Vallabhacharya, Ramanujacharya, in West-Meerabai, Eknath, Tukaram, Ramdas, Narsi Mehta, in north-Ramanand, Kabirdas, Goswami Tulsidas, Surdas, Guru Nanakdev, Sant Raidas, in East-Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Shankar Dev like saints’ ideology had strengthened Bhakti Aandolan.
In that phase, with the influence of these saints, these great men, India was able to move forward and save itself, despite a lot of adversities.
He had also shown the path that one can find God, if he comes out of cast boundary.
He said, God could be found only through Karma (duty), Jnan (enlightenment) and Bhakti (devotion).
Following the path shown by him, Sant Ramanand had boldly attacked cast system by making people from all casts and religions his followers.
Sant Kabir had also tirelessly worked to liberate the society from cast system and karmakand.
Guru Nanak Dev said- Manav ki jat sabho ek pahchanbo (Identify all human being as one cast).
Sant Vallabhacharya had shown the path of liberation by following the path of affection and love.
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu had also shown new direction against untouchability.
Such a chain of India’s saints is reflection and result of the living society.
Solutions emerge in spiritual forms for all challenges emerging in the society.
Throughout entire country, there is perhaps any such rare district or taluka, where any saint’s birth has not taken place.
Saints came as the solution to the grief of the Indian society.
They transformed the society through their lives, their teachings and literature.
The foundation of religion, philosophy and literature established during the Bhakti Aandolan, inspires us even today.
Our saints kept the importance of karma (action) in human life, human character, at highest of all.
This thought has become very much relevant at this moment, when the country has such a big fight against the black money and corruption.
Sri Madhavacharya always stressed on the fact that no work is inferior or superior.
Works performed with honesty and sincerity is like the worship of God.
He said that paying tax to the Government and serving the humanity are parallel to paying tax to the God.
We can proudly say that India has such a great tradition.
It has such great saints, great men, who utilised their devotion, their knowledge to change the fate of the nation, to build the nation.
The great stalwart like them have given such strength to the country, which is unique and incomparable.
Due to such a great saint tradition of continuous efforts to end social evils, we have been able to keep our cultural heritage intact for centuries.
Due to such a great saint tradition, we have been continuously realising the concept of national unification and nation building.
The saints of our country have always inspired the society that if any religion is superior to any other religion, that is human religion.
Our country, our society is facing challenges even today.
Saint community and Mutts are giving huge contribution in meeting these challenges.
When the saint society says that the cleanliness is God, it has more impact in comparison with any Government campaign.
This inspires towards economic cleanliness also.
If the malpractice is a challenge before the society, the modern saint community can also provide its solution.
The saint community plays a very important role with regard to environment protection.
In our culture, the trees have been considered as sensitive and alive.
Subsequently, a India’s son and great scientist Dr Jagdish Chandra Bose had also proved it before the world.
Otherwise, the world had no belief in it and they used to make fun of us.
In one way, the Indian culture possesses every answer to entire problems of the world.
In India, it is easily acceptable that one God could be worshiped in various forms.
While in India, people of various faiths have been living for centuries, not only in principles but in practical also.
We are the people who believe in equal value for all beliefs.
I wish the saint community may continue showing the path to liberate our country from the evils, like illiteracy, unawareness, mal-nutrition, black money, corruption, which have gripped our Mother India.
I wish that all of you will continue to let the people experience the power of life of our country through the spiritualism.
All of you will be continuously strengthening the power of the people through the feeling of – Vayam amritasya putraha.
With these words, I express my gratitude to all of you.
Thanks a lot !!!
Will also address a public meeting.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with H. E. Mrs. Kim Jung-sook, First Lady of the Republic of Korea today.
First Lady Kim congratulated the Prime Minister on being awarded the Seoul Peace Prize.
The Prime Minister said that this honour truly belongs to the people of India.
BRCP has made it attractive for high quality Indian scientists working abroad to return to India, and has increased the number of locations geographically within India where world-class biomedical research is undertaken.
In the extending phase, the Programme would continue to build this capacity as also strengthen clinical research and work towards addressing important health challenges for India.
“Deeply saddened by the loss of lives due to a fire at Karol Bagh in Delhi.
I convey my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives.
May the injured recover soon”, the PM said.
It gives me great pleasure to be here on the occasion of the inauguration of reading month celebration.
I thank and congratulate the P.N. Panicker foundation for organising this.
Kerala has been a torch-bearer and inspiration to the whole nation in the field of literacy.
The first 100 percent literate city and first 100 percent literate district have been from Kerala.
Kerala was also the first state to attain 100 percent primary education.
Some of the oldest colleges, schools and libraries of the country are also situated in Kerala.
He did this through Kerala Grandhasala Sangham set up by him in 1945 with 47 rural libraries.
I believe that reading and knowledge should not be limited only to work related aspects.
It should spread the idea of peace along with respect for unity and integrity of the nation.
It is said that one literate woman can educate two families.
Kerala has set an example worthy of emulation in this regard.
I learn that PN Panicker Foundation together with a number of Government agencies, private sector entities and civil society organisations, is leading an initiative of reading.
Their target is to reach 300 million under-privileged people by 2022.
The main objective of this mission is to promote reading as a means to grow and prosper.
Reading can help broaden one’s thinking.
A well-read population will help India excel globally.
With the same spirit, I had started a similar movement by name of VANCHE GUJARAT when I was Chief Minister of the State.
The movement targeted the young generation, in particular.
I appealed to people to give a book instead of bouquet as a greeting.
Such a move can make a big difference.
From the time of the Upanishads persons with knowledge have been respected through the ages.
We are now in the information age.
Even today, knowledge is the best guiding light.
I am told that as a pilot project of Digital Libraries, Panicker Foundation is working with 18 public libraries in the state in collaboration with Indian Public Library Movement, New Delhi.
I would like to see such a reading and library movement in the entire country.
The movement should not be limited to make people literate.
It should try to achieve the real goal of bringing social and economic change.
The foundation of good knowledge should be followed by a super-structure of a better society.
I am happy to note that the State Government has announced 19th June as the reading day.
Obviously, a lot of effort will converge to make this a popular activity.
The Government of India has also provided support to the activities of the foundation.
I am told that about 1.20 crore rupees have been given to the foundation in the last two years.
I am also happy to see that the foundation is now focusing on digital literacy.
This is the need of the hour.
I believe in people’s power.
It has the capacity to make a better society and nation.
I urge every young person in the audience to take a pledge of reading.
And enable everyone to do so.
GSAT-6A, a communication satellite, will provide new possibilities for mobile applications.
Rt. Hon. Theresa May, British Prime Minister made a telephone call to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.
The two Prime Ministers exchanged greetings on the occasion of the festival of Diwali, celebrated recently.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, reforms of the UN Security Council is in global interest and vital for a more inclusive and equitable world.
As I said before, we should quickly adopt the draft presented by the President of the General Assembly as the negotiating text and conclude negotiations during the 70th Session of the General Assembly.
The ships could also extend support in areas like healthcare through medical camps on the islands.
Not only is our future closely linked to Space and Oceans, there is also a close relationship between the two.
Space assets and technology can help us in inventory of land and water resources; fish zoning; forest resources management; coastal and ocean studies; weather and climate change; and, disaster management support.
We can assist in establishing a ‘Space Technology Applications Centre’ in any one of the Pacific Island Countries for the entire region and enhance our support for training in space applications, including through customized courses.
Fiji’s support was invaluable for our Mars Mission.
We hope to continue receiving support from Pacific Islands for Telemetry, Tracking and Command for our missions in the future.
We are all increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters, but we can reduce their human impact.
India will be pleased to create capacity in Island States to deal with natural disasters, including through human resource development and application of space technology for early warning system and incident response.
Human resource development has been a key area of cooperation.
There is no other form of cooperation that is as effective in building a nation’s future.
For the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation training programme, Fiji will get 110 slots, and the number of slots for the other 13 countries will be doubled from 119 to 238.
We will expand our training courses for Pacific Island diplomats and, in addition, offer a two-week business management course at the globally renowned Indian Institute of Management in Bengaluru.
During the last three years, India has trained 43 rural women from 8 island countries as solar engineers.
We now commit to train 70 women solar engineers and to provide solar electrification to 2,800 houses – 200 houses in each Pacific Island Country.
This will save kerosene worth about a million US dollars and provide livelihood to women.
I am pleased to announce that we will establish at least one information technology laboratory in each Pacific Island country.
This will not only improve local IT infrastructure, it will enable us to fulfill our commitment to provide tele-medicine and tele-education to the people.
We are prepared to do more to strengthen our trade.
In addition to the FIPIC Trade Office in New Delhi, we can support the development of micro, small and medium enterprises and will extend support for purchase of machinery for coconut processing and enhancing rice and sugarcane yields.
Human bonds are the strongest foundation for enduring relations between nations.
We will also support creation of India Centres through e-libraries and supply books to libraries at universities in your countries.
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has thanked Prime Minister of Pakistan Mr. Nawaz Sharif, for assistance by Pakistan in evacuation of Indian Citizens from Yemen.
I congratulate President Ramaphosa on the success of BRICS Summit in Johannesburg in July and hosting this meeting.
In BRICS we represent 42% of the world’s population.
Since last few years BRICS has been the engine of Global Growth.
They are not in line with our population.
Globalization has brought millions of people out of poverty.
However, we have challenges of equal distribution of benefits of globalization before us.
BRICS countries have been contributing to global sustainability and development.
We have played an important role in shaping the economic and political structure of the world.
We, BRICS countries, are eager to cooperate in the new Industrial Revolution.
Portability of social security schemes of workers and smooth movement of laborers worldwide is very important.
Social-economic issues like women’s empowerment and sustainable food future will be raised in the G20 Summit.
On sustainable development and infrastructure, earlier I had suggested the need for disaster resilient infrastructure.
We have to work together to take it forward.
India values and appreciates the progress made in enhancing BRICS political exchanges.
In this regard, meetings between our Foreign Ministers, NSAs and special messengers from Middle East have made important contributions.
We all agree that terrorism and radicalization are the biggest threats that the whole world is facing today.
We need to work together against economic offenders and fugitives.
This problem can be a serious threat to the world’s economic stability.
Our support base in the G20 has started to become strong.
Our BRICS Sherpas have been consulting and cooperating in G20 areas.
G20 Summit is being headed by a developing country.
It is a good opportunity that the focus of the G20 agenda and its results should be brought to the priorities of the developing countries.
In the end, once again I thank President Ramaphosa for the successful hosting of the Johannesburg Summit and for organizing this meeting.
I also confirm full support and cooperation of India to Brazil and its leadership for the forthcoming BRICS Chairmanship.
I am confident that BRICS cooperation will scale new heights under the Chairmanship of Brazil.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the demise of Former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
India grieves the demise of our beloved Atal Ji.
His passing away marks the end of an era.
He lived for the nation and served it assiduously for decades.
My thoughts are with his family, BJP Karyakartas and millions of admirers in this hour of sadness.
It was Atal Ji’s exemplary leadership that set the foundations for a strong, prosperous and inclusive India in the 21st century.
His futuristic policies across various sectors touched the lives of each and every citizen of India.
Atal Ji’s passing away is a personal and irreplaceable loss for me.
I have countless fond memories with him.
He was an inspiration to Karyakartas like me.
I will particularly remember his sharp intellect and outstanding wit.
It was due to the perseverance and struggles of Atal Ji that the BJP was built brick by brick.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has bowed to Shaheed Bhagat Singh, on his birth anniversary.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today reviewed the progress of the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY).
Senior Government officials briefed him on aspects such as addressing of debt, monitoring frameworks, improvement in financial parameters, operational achievements, and consumer empowerment.
During a presentation on coal mine and mineral block auctions made by senior Government officials, the Prime Minister emphasized on a roadmap for faster operationalization of mines, post-auction.
He also called for greater coordination between all mineral-related departments during the survey and mapping of geological potential regions.
Respected senior dignitaries seated on the dais, brothers and sisters, Sai Ram.
We should do all the work that is possible on that day.
When I go to bed at night I would have completed my visit to five states today.
I left Delhi, reached Chhattisgarh, then I will go to Odisha.
From Odisha I will go to West Bengal and then I will go to Uttar Pradesh.
When ‘Janta Janardan’ assigns you some responsibility then you should try to complete it whole heartedly.
The work he had done in the area of water supply, education and health are indeed very inspiring.
Today the draft of a new policy was presented before you on innovation and Entrepreneurship.
I congratulate Raman Singh and his government for their thinking in this direction.
The Government policies should be encouraging these small entrepreneurs.
Some time he had to flee from his village and at times to leave the world.
Under the scheme, arrangements have been made to provide funds worth Rs.50,000 to 10 lakh without guarantee.
So far, 20 million people have been granted funds and almost one million billion rupees has been dispensed to them without seeking any form of guarantee.
The idea here is that they expand their businesses and provide employment to poor people.
They provide employment to one, two, four people and this is going to create job opportunities.
There is prevailing belief in the world that for economic growth the push will come from the private sector and the public sector entities like government PSUs or corporate houses.
For a country like India, yet another mode is required which is the personal sector.
Private sector has its own relevance, public sector has its own importance but personal sector is the one where each individual becomes an Entrepreneur.
The State has come with this policy today to give a fillip to entrepreneurship.
He should get finance from ‘Mudra Yojna’, get skill from Skill Development Program and then an environment of positive market should be created.
I’m glad that of out of two billion people who received help, almost 70 percent are from SCs, STs or OBCs.
Women Entrepreneurs have also come forward in very large numbers.
And I believe that the youth of Chhattisgarh will be benefited.
‘Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojna’ is also being launched today.
Neither do they have land nor the money.
There is no environment for the family nor he has the dreams.
But if he is given a small house, he is willing to pay back.
Then he saves 10 rupees and gets a doormat.
States governments across the country need to act fast and decide what would be the location of the land to build such housing units.
His dreams will get a new life with this shelter.
And with those dreams the country will scale new heights in 2022.
With this belief I once again convey my greetings to Raman Singh Ji and his team.
Sriman Venkaiah ji is the Minister of this Department and is working day and night.
I believe that this dream shall come true.
Your Majesties, Chairperson of the African Union, His Excellency Robert Mugabe Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Madam Dlamini-Zuma, Excellencies,
The fabric of this world is richer because of the 54 sovereign flags of Africa.
Today, their brilliant colours have made Delhi the most special place in the world.
To the 41 Heads of State and Government and the other eminent leaders; to the hundreds of senior officials, business leaders and journalists from Africa, I say this: we are deeply, deeply honoured by your presence today.
To our visitors from the land where history began, humanity grew and new hope rises;
From the deserts of the north, where the glory of human civilization shines through the shifting sands of time;
From the south, where the conscience of our age has been forged – from Mahatma Gandhi to Albert Luthuli to Nelson Mandela;
A very warm embrace of welcome and friendship from India.
Today, the heart beat of 1.25 billion Indians and 1.25 billion Africans are in rhythm.
We are among the world’s oldest civilisations.
We are each a vibrant mosaic of languages, religions and cultures.
The currents of the mighty ocean have nurtured the ties of kinship, commerce, and culture through centuries.
Generations of Indians and Africans have travelled to each other’s land in search of their destiny or by the force of circumstances.
Either way, we have enriched each other and strengthened our ties.
We have lived in the long shadow of colonialism.
And, we have fought for our liberty and our dignity.
And, if the future belongs to the youth, then this century is ours to shape and build.
We are all familiar with Africa’s ancient achievements.
Now, its modern strides are catching the attention of the world.
The continent is more settled and stable.
African nations are coming together to take responsibility for their development, peace and security.
Women now constitute around 20% of the elected Members of Parliament in Africa.
To one who has played a role in that, President Sirleaf, I extend our best wishes on your birthday today.
Africa’s economic growth has gathered momentum and has a more diversified base.
African initiatives are replacing old fault lines with new bridges of regional economic integration.
We see many successful examples of economic reforms, infrastructure development and sustainable use of resources.
They are turning adrift economies into dynamic ones.
The mobile banking of M-Pesa, the healthcare innovation of MedAfrica, or the agriculture innovation of AgriManagr and Kilimo Salama, are using mobile and digital technology to transform lives in Africa.
We see strong measures that are radically improving healthcare, education and agriculture.
Primary school enrolment in Africa now exceeds 90%.
And, across its magnificent landscape, Africa is setting standards in wildlife conservation and eco-tourism.
Africa’s sports, art and music delight the entire world.
Yes, Africa, like the rest of the developing world, has its development challenges.
And, like others in the world, it has its own concerns of security and stability, especially from terrorism and extremism.
But, I have confidence in African leadership and the African people to rise to those challenges.
for the past six decades, so much of our independent journeys have been together.
Now, so much of India’s development priorities and Africa’s lofty vision for its future are aligned.
Today, Africa and India are two bright spots of hope and opportunities in the global economy.
India is honoured to be a development partner for Africa.
It is a partnership beyond strategic concerns and economic benefits.
It is formed from the emotional bonds we share and the solidarity we feel for each other.
In less than a decade, our trade has more than doubled to over 70 billion dollars.
India is now a major source of business investments in Africa.
Today, 34 African countries enjoy duty free access to the Indian market.
In the last three years alone, nearly 25,000 young Africans have been trained and educated in India.
They are the 25,000 new links between us.
There are times when we have not done as well as you have wanted us to.
There have been occasions when we have not been as attentive as we should be.
There are commitments we have not fulfilled as quickly as we should have.
But, you have always embraced India with warmth, and without judgement.
You have rejoiced in our success, and taken pride in our achievements.
And, you have stood for us in the world.
This is the strength of our partnership and our friendship.
And, as we travel on the road ahead, we will do so with the wisdom of our experience and the benefit of your guidance.
We will raise the level of our support for your vision of a prosperous,integrated, and united Africa that is a major partner for the world.
As the great Nigerian Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka insisted, human entity remains the primary asset in overall development.
It also opens doors to opportunities for the youth.
So, development of human capital in every walk of life will be at the heart of our partnership.
The Egyptian Nobel Prize winning writer Naguib Mahfouz said, “Science brings people together with the light of its ideas…and prods us towards a better future.”
There can be no better expression of the ability of science to unify people and advance progress.
So, technology will be a strong foundation of our partnership.
It will help develop Africa’s agriculture sector.
Agriculture in Africa can drive the continent’s march to prosperity, and also support global food security.
We will also collaborate to develop Indian and African treasures of traditional knowledge and medicines.
We will make available our space assets and technology.
We will use the possibilities of digital technology to transform development, public services, governance, disaster response, resource management and quality of life.
We will cooperate for sustainable development of Blue Economy that will become important future drivers of our prosperity.
When the sun sets, tens of millions of homes in India and Africa become dark.
We want to light up lives of our people and power their future.
No one has done less to contribute to global warming than India and Africa.
No one can be more conscious of climate change than Indians and Africans.
For India, 175 Gigawatts of additional renewable energy capacity by 2022 and reduction in emission intensity by 33-35% by 2030 are just two aspects of our efforts.
We will also deepen India-Africa partnership on clean energy, sustainable habitats, public transport and climate resilient agriculture.
But, it is also true that the excess of few cannot become the burden of many.
So, when the world meets in Paris in December, we look to see a comprehensive and concrete outcome that is based on the well established principles in the UN Convention on Climate Change.
We will all do our part for it.
But, we also want to see a genuine global public partnership that makes clean energy affordable; provides finance and technology to developing countries to access it; and the means to adapt to the impact of climate change.
Our goal is to make solar energy an integral part of our life and reach it to the most unconnected villages and communities.
India and Africa seek also seek a global trading regime that serves our development goals and improves our trade prospects.
When we meet at Nairobi Ministerial of the WTO in December, we must ensure that the Doha Development Agenda of 2001 is not closed without achieving these fundamental objectives.
The world is undergoing political, economic, technological and security transition on a scale and speed rarely seen in recent history.
We cannot say what will replace them in an uncertain future.
But, we might have a more fragmented world that is less capable of dealing with the challenges of our era.
That is why India advocates reforms in global institutions.
This is a world of free nations and awakened aspirations.
That is why India and Africa must speak in one voice for reforms of the United Nations, including its Security Council.
Today, in many parts of the world, the light of a bright future flickers in the storm of violence and instability.
When terror snuffs out life on the streets and beaches, and in malls and schools of Africa, we feel your pain as our own.
And, we see the links that unite us against this threat.
We also see that when our oceans are no longer safe for trade, we all suffer together.
And, when Nations are caught in conflict within, no one around remains untouched.
So, when it comes to security, distance no longer insulates us from each other.
We will also offer a grant assistance of 600 million U.S. dollars.
This will include an India-Africa Development Fund of 100 million U.S. dollars and an India-Africa Health Fund of 10 million U.S. dollars.
It will also include 50,000 scholarships in India over the next five years.
And, it will support the expansion of the Pan Africa E-Network and institutions of skilling, training and learning across Africa.
We will work together:
But, this is a new promise of a great future for an ancient relationship.
Friends, Gone are the days, when India was considered to be among the ‘Fragile Five’.
Today, we are the fastest growing economy in the world.
Powered by the Hundred and Twenty Five Crore people of India, we will grow even faster.
As per an international report, poverty is declining in India at a record pace.
5 crore people have moved out of poverty in the last two years according to the report.
Who do you think is making this possible?
It is the people of India.
The Government can only play the role of an enabler.
It is the youth, who are not only making use of available opportunities but also creating new ones themselves.
This is our new India.
Who’s at the lead of this?
Young doctors, nurses, support staff and volunteers.
India built 1.75 lakh kilometres of rural roads in the last 4 years.
Who built them?
Young labourers and workers.
Now, we are electrifying every home.
Eighty Five lakh homes have been electrified since October 2017.
Who brightened the homes of their fellow citizens?
Young Electricians and Technicians.
Who made 4 crore and 65 lakhs gas connections reach the poor?
Yet again, India’s youth.
More than one crore homes have been built for the poor in the last 4 years.
Who did it?
It was young engineers, masons and labourers who made this possible.
India needs more skilled manpower Skill India is for that.
India needs villages connected with i-ways we have laid 2.7 lakh km of optical fiber network connecting more than a lakh gram panchayats.
India needs more entrepreneurs Mudra and Standup India are for that.
India needs affordable healthcare आयुष्मान भारत is for that.
India needs its startup generation to prosper today you can register a startup very quickly.
There is a level playing field in public procurement for startups too!
When we create more employment opportunities, we empower the youth to improve his future.
When the future of every citizen improves, the future of India and stature of India in the world improves!
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has conveyed his best wishes to the people of Brazil, on their Independence Day.
I see great potential for India-Brazil ties to grow even further, which will benefit the people of both our Nations”, the Prime Minister said.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the introduction of a Bill namely The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2018 in the Parliament for certain amendments in the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950 so as to modify the list of Scheduled Tribes (STs) of Arunachal Pradesh.
Replace Tai Khamti’ instead of ‘Khampti’ at serial No. 6.
Inclusion of ‘Mishmi-Kaman’ (Miju Mishmi), Idu (Mishmi) and Taraon (Digaru Mishmi) in serial No. 8.
Inclusion of Monpa, Memba, Sartang, Sajolong (Miji) in serial No. 9 in lieu of ‘Momba’.
Laying out the broad contours of India’s development path, the Prime Minister said that judicious and intelligent application of India’s natural resources and human resources, would be at the heart of this change.
Giving several illustrations of this theme, he mentioned use of available land, the country’s mineral wealth, and vast untapped solar energy potential.
In a similar way, he said India has made sub-optimal use so far of its vast coastline.
Turning to Agriculture, the Prime Minister said the focus cannot be on increasing agricultural productivity alone, but should be on the overall development of a vibrant rural economy.
He emphasized the importance of the food processing sector, warehouse development, and technology inputs, in this sector.
The Prime Minister said that the intentions (niyat) of the policy-makers are even more important than the policies (niti) themselves.
Stressing on the need to build capacities for good governance, he highlighted the importance of real-time data availability.
He urged the NITI Aayog to take inspiration from events such as the success of the Give-it-Up campaign, and the widespread positive response from the people to the Swachhta Abhiyan.
This experience disproves the assumption commonly made by experts that people are only interested in benefits for themselves; it shows that people are motivated by the larger public good.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has expressed condolences on the passing away of Mr. George Fernandes.
The Prime Minister said, “George Sahab represented the best of India’s political leadership.
Saddened by his passing away.
When we think of Mr. George Fernandes, we remember most notably the fiery trade union leader who fought for justice, the leader who could humble the mightiest of politicians at the hustings, a visionary Railway Minister and a great Defence Minister who made India safe and strong.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today reviewed the progress towards holistic development of islands.
The Union Government had constituted the Islands Development Agency on June 1st, 2017.

Reviewing the work done in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Prime Minister emphasized on the need for developing an integrated tourism-centric ecosystem, in the areas identified for tourism development.
He called for expeditious pursuit of energy self-sufficiency in the islands, which could be based on solar energy.

The next edition of Mann ki Baat will be in 2016.
We celebrated Christmas and preparations are now on to ring in the New Year.
India is land of diversities..
We celebrate a whole lot of festivals.
One is not done with one festival, in the mean time the second one comes along.
In a way one festival leaves us waiting for another.
At times it feels India is one such country which has a ‘festival driven economy’.
It becomes a source of the economic activities for even the poor sections of the society.
Greetings from my end for a Merry Christmas to all Indians and I also wish you all a Happy New Year.
May 2016 usher in lots of joys in your lives.
I hope that new zeal, new excitement and new pledges may take you to new heights.
May the world be free of crises, be it from terrorism, from global warming or from natural calamities or manmade tragedies.
There can be no greater happiness than the humanity having a peaceful existence.
Mr. Ganesh V. Savleshwarkar has written to me from Pune that this season is a tourist season.
A large number of foreign and domestic tourists travel across the country.
People also travel to celebrate Christmas vacations.
India’s image will be enhanced if the tourist destinations are clean.
In a similar manner, the onus is on us to maintain our tourist destinations and pilgrim tourism sites neat and clean.
I am very happy that a lot of news stories related to cleanliness keep appearing in the media space.
He is a mason by profession to earn his livelihood.
He did something so different that the newspapers printed his story.
And when it came to my notice, I wanted to share this story with you.
Hailing from a small village, Dileep Singh Malviya decided that if anyone provides materials for toilet in the village, he will render his labour services free of cost.
And hats off to him, he has constructed 100 toilets in Bhojpura village so far taking it as a divine cause and providing his labour services without charging a penny.
My heartfelt congratulations to Dileep Singh Malviya for his earnest efforts.
Sometimes we hear disappointing news about our nation.
But there are thousands of people like Dileep Singh who are doing something good for the nation on their own.
This is the hope of the nation and these are the things which carry the nation forward and it is natural that we applaud Dileep Singh and his efforts in Mann ki Baat.
Due to tireless efforts of many people the nation is making rapid progress.
People from normal backgrounds who could not step inside banks can now avail loan facilities from the “Mudra Yojana.”
Such emotions arise when we see the enormity of our nation.
No one can forget the story of Krishna and Yashoda where he opened his mouth and the mother was able to see the entire universe, and then only his power could be realized.
The Yoga incident was a similar reminder.
The concept of cleanliness is being echoed in every household.
The participation of citizens is also increasing.
The media has not discussed this topic.
But I am sure that media will definitely reach such villages and will inform the nation about the happiness and excitement of the people there.
The biggest achievement of this task is that the government officials involved in this task will have immense satisfaction that they have done something which will bring about such a big change in the lives of the people and the village itself.
Be it the farmers, poor, young or women, should such things reach them or not?
People should get information in order to avail their rights.
We should all make efforts that right information, good information and information useful to the common man should reach as many people as possible.
This is also a kind of service.
I too have tried to do this work from my end.
Even a common man can download the Narendra Modi App and get connected to me.
And I can share these small things with you through the app.
And it is a matter of happiness for me that people share all the things with me.
You too get connected with this initiative, we have to reach 125 crore Indians.
How will I reach without your help?
Come, let us collectively do such things of interest for the common man in their language and inspire them to avail things which are their rights.
My dear young friends, I had some preliminary discussions about “Start-up India, Stand-up India” in my speech on 15th August from the Red Fort.
Can our states work together for new Start-ups for youth, and encourage innovations with start-ups, be it in the manufacturing sector, service sector or agriculture.
“Start-up India, Stand-up India” brings in a huge opportunity for the young generation.
My dear young friends, the government will launch the entire action plan for “Start-up India, Stand-up India on 16th January.
In this program all the IIT’s, IIM’s, Central Universities, NIT’s, wherever there is young generation, they will be brought together via live connectivity.
There is an established thinking regarding the Start-ups that they are meant only for the digital world or the IT profession.
This is not true at all; we need to modify it according to the needs of India.
Similarly is the intellectual wealth limited to a few selected cities or what?
And I will request the state governments to take this forward.
Dear young friends, 12th January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
There are thousands like me who draw inspiration from him.
Since 1995, 12th January, the birth Anniversary of Vivekananda is celebrated as the National Youth Festival.
This year it will be organized from 12-16th January in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh.
A mini-India will be created there.
They will share dreams together.
A feeling of determination will be experienced.
Can you give me suggestions regarding this youth festival?
I would request the youth to send me their suggestions directly on the “Narendra Modi App”.
I want to gain an insight into your understanding.
So I will wait dear friends for your suggestions on the youth festival on the “Narendra Modi App”.
I think it was a great initiative by you.”
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
You are yourself working in this field.
You understand everything and you must have faced a lot of difficulties too.
Sometimes when we meet someone with different ability in the society then a lot of things come to our mind.
We express our perception of him based on our thinking.
There are some people who lose a limb or body part in an accident.
Some people are born with some defects.
So I thought that upon looking at them with our eyes we feel that they are handicapped, but experiences tell us that they have some extra power.
So I thought why not use the term ‘Divyang’ instead of ‘viklang’ in our country.
They are those people who have one or more such organs which have divinity, where divine power flows which we normal bodied people do not have.
I like this term.
My dear countrymen can we make it a habit to use the word ‘Divyang’ and make it popular.
I hope that you will take this forward.
That day we started the ‘Sugamya Bharat’ campaign.
Under this campaign we will improve both the physical and virtual infrastructure and make it accessible for the ‘Divyang’ people.
Be it schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, railway stations, everywhere ramps, accessible parking, accessible lifts, Braille, many amenities will be made available.
To make things Sugamya – we need innovation, we need technology, we need systems and we also need empathy from people.
You too can join in the manner you deem fit.
After all, these schemes are meant for common man, the poor people.
In the past few days the government has made an effort to ensure that the benefits of schemes reach out to the rightful owners.
In our country, we give subsidy for the gas cylinders.
Crores of rupees were spent on it but we did not know if it reached the right people or not, if this subsidy reached people on time or not?
The Government has made some changes in the scheme.
The government undertook the largest ‘Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme’ to provide subsidy directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries with the help of ‘Jan Dhan Account’ or ‘Aadhar Card’ etc.
I am happy to share with the countrymen that this scheme has earned a place in Guinness Book of World Records as the largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme which has been implemented successfully.
This scheme is known as ‘Pahal’ and this experiment has been very successful.
Till November end, around 15 crore LPG customers have become its beneficiaries.
The government money is being directly transferred to the accounts of 15 crore beneficiaries.
No middlemen nor any recommendation, nor any possibility of corruption.
Nowadays, even the MNREGA scheme, which provides employment opportunities in villages, is being connected to it.
There were lots of complaints about this scheme.
In many places the wages of the labourers is now being directly transferred into their accounts.
There were complaints about student scholarships too; they too are being transferred into their accounts.
This has been started and will be gradually taken forward.
Till now around 40,000 crore rupees are directly reaching the beneficiaries through various schemes.
According to my rough estimate, around 35-40 schemes are now under ‘Direct Benefit Transfer.’
Can Republic Day be an opportunity to connect the masses with the system?
But constitution equally emphasizes on duty also.
But it is seen that duties are hardly discussed.
At the most, whenever there are elections, then we see advertisement all around us, they write on the walls and hoardings are put to tell that to vote is our sacred duty.
There is a lot of talk about duties during elections, but why not discuss our duties in general life too.
This year when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar then can we make 26th January a medium to organize debates, poetry, slogan competition regarding duties in our own schools, colleges, villages, cities and various organizations and societies.
If 125 crore Indians take dutiful steps one after the other, they can make history.
But at least let’s start with discussions.
Send them on my portal ‘My Gov”.
I would like to know what my young generation thinks about their duties.
I want to give a small suggestion.
And I am not saying this on government lines.
We become so emotional about getting the statues of great men erected but become equally complacent when it comes to maintaining them.
As a society, as a nation can we make it a natural tendency to respect the statues of our great men?
On this 26th January let us make an effort that we will respect such great men and keep the premises clean.
But this should be done by the citizens willfully.
Dear Countrymen, greetings to you for a Happy New Year 2016.
Thank You Very Much!

Friends, The India Science Congress has a rich legacy.
In 1917, आचार्य जगदीश चंद्र बोस established India’s first dedicated Scientific Research Centre, the Bose Institute of Calcutta.
His inaugural speech was a reflection of his holistic views of science.
He said,“I dedicate today this institute not merely a laboratory but a temple to the nation”.

It is through our modern temples of science that India is transforming its present and working to secure its future.
Friends, our former Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji gave us the slogan, जय जवान जय किसान।
Twenty years ago in a historic address at Pokhran, our great Prime Mnister Atal Ji had recognized the contributions of science and technology for India.
I believe it is now time to take one more step forward.
Indeed the pursuit of vigyan is fulfilled through achievement of two objectives.
The first is, generation of profound or disruptive knowledge.
The second is consumption of that knowledge for socio economic good.
As we push our discovery science eco-system, we must also focus on innovation and startups.
Our government has launched the Atal Innovation Mission to promote innovation among our scientists.
More technology business incubators have been established in the last four years then in the forty year before that.
Industry must now contribute by providing timely direction, vision, mentorship and partnership to the Startups.
Our scientists must commit themselves to addressing problems of affordable health care, housing, cleaneair,water and energy, agriculture productivity and food processing.
While science is universal, technology must be local for providing solutions relevant to the local needs and conditions.
Scope us data wise indicates that India is positioned among the top five nations of the world in terms of the number of scientific publications.
This is no mean achievement and deserve whole hearted appreciation.
Friends, in the Tirupati Session up Indian Science Congress I had spoken about the Global rise or fiber physical systems.

We can turn it into the huge opportunity by research, training and skilling in robotics, artificial intelligence, big data analytics.
The government has approved a national mission on interdisciplinary cyber physical systems with an investment of over three thousand six hundred crores.
The mission will cover in a seamless wayRND, technology development, human resource and skills, innovation, Startup Eco System and strong industry and international collaborations.
Data is the engine that drives artificial intelligence.
Our scientists working with relevant ministries should evolve effective data policy and practices that holistically cover the ground from data generation to data flow, to data protection, to data sharing, to data used.
Friends, India needs a new futuristic road map for science and technology and innovation.
With these objectives we have recently made the Prime Science Technology an innovation advisory council.
This council will help formulate appropriate science and technology interventions, catalyse collaborations across stake holders, ministries and implement multistake holder policy initiatives.
Government is in the process of improving the quality of education with particular focus on higher education sector.
We have liberalized the higher education sector.
UGC has brought out graded autonomy regulations to give functional and financial autonomy to well performing universities and colleges.

These efforts will infuse competition, bring private investment and improve quality of higher education institutions.
We have launched the Prime Minister Research fellows.
The schemes under which a thousand bright minds from the best institutions in the country will be offered direct admission in PhD program in IITs and IISC.
The scheme will catalyse quality research and address shortage of faculty in the premier education institutions.

India is brimming with a new generation of creative, energetic and confident minds.
The government is committed to provide them an enabling environment for building a New India through science.
An India that is fully ready to take the challenges and opportunities of the present and the future.

Today, we are celebrating the Foundation day of Institute of Charted Accountant of India (ICAI).My heartfelt wishes to one and all on this momentous occasion.
Serendipity indeed!
It is indeed a matter of happiness and privilege that I am amidst you on such a historical day.
Its only your fraternity which is authorized to Certify and Audit the entries in Account books and confirm whether they are correct or manipulated.
Chartered Accountants of India have earned laurels across the globe for their dexterity in Financial Skills.
Today, I got the opportunity to launch the new Chartered Accountancy Course Curriculum.
This is the identity of your Dynamic Course and the Credibility of Examinations.
I am hopeful that this new course will further consolidate the financial skills of new aspirants joining this profession.
You might have heard from the experienced in the society that in case a house is engulfed in fire and there is complete loss of property, it is said that the family can get back on its own with its will power and perseverance.
They cope up with the trauma but begin afresh with the same fervour.
Within no time they bounce back.
Even if one family member treads the wrong path, the family is shattered once and for all.
Dear friends, you are engaged in setting the accounts right If we are righteous, the country can be salvaged from the biggest of crises.
During the worst of the natural calamities like floods and earthquakes, the citizens have shown their capabilities to take care of the cause of the nation while supporting the administration.
However, if some of the citizens of the country are into the habit of stealing and pilferage, it leads to an irreparable damage to the family and the nation.
While new laws have been formulated, older laws have been made more stringent now.
The latest statistics from Swiss bank accounts stand a testimony to the strict measures by the government on the Black Money issue.
As reported by the Swiss Bank Authorities, the black money deposits of Indian Nationals have a hit a record all time low.
Three decades back in 1987, these officials from Swiss Banks had started declaring how much deposits were being made by nationals of a country.
According to the reports released for the last financial year, there has been a reduction of 45% in the deposits made by Indians in the Swiss banks..
Ever since 2014, the day you all entrusted us with the reins of the nation, we have put brakes on the trends.
I am sure 8th November is ingrained deep in your minds.
Demonetization was a firm and landmark step to wipe out the black money and corruption from our systems.
My dear friends, I have already said that your patriotism is no less than mine.
Those who have looted the poor will have to return that to the poor.
Apart from this, the government has already identified more than 37 thousand Shell companies who are engaged in hiding black money and hawala transactions.
Stern actions shall be taken against them.
More stringent actions are in store for the companies who will break the law in future.
And I am fully aware of the fact that eliminating fake companies and taking action against black money can be politically incorrect and pose a risk to any political party.
But someone has to take such tough decisions for the sake of the country.
My Chartered Accountant friends, I have come here on the occasion of the Foundation day of your institute.
I want to ask you a light question.
These thieves and robbers must have gone to some economic doctor.
I know very well that those companies might not have come to any of you for this purpose.
But they have definitely taken the help of someone who needs to be identified.
Don’t you feel the need to identify such people, who are sitting among you, who supported these companies?
Friends, I have been told that there are more than two lakh 72 thousand Chartered Accountants in our country.
I would place some more facts for you since you grasp things quickly from the figures.
It is estimated that there are more than crore engineers and management graduates in our country.
There are more than 8 lakh doctors.
These professions are perceived to be the cream professions or are highly respectable jobs.
There are crores of people in such professions in our country.
Moreover, there are crores of palatial houses built in the cities of our country.
Also, about two crore 18 lakh people had travelled abroad last year.
Are there only 32 lakh people in this country who earn more than 10 lakhs?
This is the bitter truth of our country, my beloved companions.
These numbers show that only 32 lakh people in the country reveal their income to be more than ten lakh rupees.
I believe that most of the people in the country are salaried class, where people have fixed income and most of the salary is drawn from the government.
Besides this, what is the actual situation in the country?
And so brothers I do not want to project data further.
But by this you will understand that crores of vehicles are purchased every year in the country.
And yet the responsibilities towards the country are not getting fulfilled; it is a matter of grave concern.
Instead of referring to more data, I want to put my thoughts before you.
CA brothers, a person or a client pays taxes only when the environment around him is conducive which motivates him to pay the taxes honestly.
If he sees that the advisor himself is asking him to hide the truth then he will boldly traverse the wrong path.
Thus it is equally important to identify such wrong advisors and take strict actions against them.
And for that you also have to take tough steps.
Did only 25 people make a mess?
And I have heard that more than 1400 cases are still pending for many years now.
A single case takes years to settle.
Despite this, all the lawyers of that era who had well flourishing law profession left their advocacy for this country.
Not only Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Dr. Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru but also Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Motilal Nehru, C. Rajagopalachari, , Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, Saifuddin Kichloo, Bhulabhai Desai, Lalalajpat Rai , Tej Bahadur Sapru, Asaf Ali, Govind Vallabh Pant, Kailash Nathkatju uncountable names in the law profession who had laid their lives for the country.
Inspired by patriotism, they dedicated their lives for the country’s independence.
Many of them played a decisive role in framing of our constitution.
And brothers and sisters, we cannot forget that these great men are indispensable part of our country’s history.
Friends, today our country is at another crucial juncture of history.
On this historic occasion the most important role is that of the Chartered Accountants.
Try to fathom my feelings, friends.
During the freedom movement, the lawyers had placed their lives at stake for the freedom of India.
Today, I am not asking you all to put your lives at stake.
You do not have to go behind the bars.
And you can see that no one but you can make this road to the greater economic development stronger.
I request you again to take your clients to the path of honesty so as to end corruption.
To eliminate corruption, you have to take the command.
Friends, Chartered Accountants are like ambassadors of any country’s economic system.
Your work is like that of an interface between the government and the tax-paying companies and individuals.
Companies may be small or big, however, if you certify their books of account then the government believes in that, people of the country believe in that.
Friends, a new chapter begins after that.
Today, I’ve come here to showcase that new life to you people.
If you certify the account books of a company then the government officers trust in your assessment.
The company grows, it flourishes and you people also grow, flourish with that.
Friends, however, the matter doesn’t end there.
They invest their lifetime savings only on the basis of just one signature of yours.
The first of July, the date of your foundation, gives you another opportunity to restore that faith.
Please look at the importance of your work and then choose your path.
Friends, there are different definitions for the term ‘tax return’.
However, I feel that whatever taxes are collected by a government whether those taxes have been utilised in the development of the country or not?
This is the ‘tax return’.
It plays an important role in curbing inflation.
It provides a gas connection to a lady who has used woods for cooking food all her life.
This fund is used in giving old age pension to those whose children shirked their responsibility of looking after them.
This money is used in providing self-employment to the youth who works hard throughout the day so that he can attend evening classes to complete his education.
This money is being used in providing electricity to those households that don’t have electricity supply even after seventy years of independence.
When I was on the way to this place, Neelesh told me that you people are going to help the traders to understand GST.
I congratulate him, I offer my gratitude.
You please reach out to the people, enlighten them.
Encourage them to join the mainstream of integrity.
In a way, the government has provided a fresh opportunity to the people in the field of chartered accountancy.
Please prepare yourself for this; I specifically urge the young professionals in this field.
Please come forward, Chartered Accountants have an extremely important role in the success and proper implementation of the laws recently passed by the government, particularly the insolvency and bankruptcy code.
Under this code when a company has been declared bankrupt then its control will be passed on to an insolvency practitioner.
Chartered accountants can start a new career in this field by becoming insolvency practitioners.
This is a new avenue opened by the government for you people.
However, whichever path you people choose today, in that path, the term CA should mean Charter and Accuracy, Compliance and Authenticity.
You people should prepare the programme on the occasion of 75 years of your existence from today itself.
You should prepare a roadmap for that historic occasion from today itself to scale new heights for the institution and its character.
You will have to decide on this.
You set a target for yourself that how many people you will bring in the mainstream by honestly paying the taxes.
Who can be a better judge than you yourself to set a target for this task?
Please also think how you can expand the role of technology in your profession.
He said: “Kalati Kramat Kal Avam Falam Pivati”, it means the time itself undermines the value of the success of something if it was not done in the right time.
Therefore don’t let your time go in vain.
Arun Ji was talking to you just a while ago; he was saying that India never had this kind of opportunity before.
It is a rare opportunity for you people as well.
Don’t let this opportunity go past you.
I’ve come to invite you to associate yourself with the mainstream of India’s development.
Please don’t lose sight of the fact this profession has the capacity to protect, to sustain the entire economy.
I once again convey my best wishes to the entire faculty of the institute, to all the chartered accountants present here on the occasion of the foundation day of ICAI.
I also thank the people who are watching this programme through the video link and also to those chartered accountants of our country who are watching this programme in other countries.

The Prime Minister said, ” In every state there are a few districts where development parameters are strong.
We can learn from them and work on weaker districts.
A spirit of competitive and cooperative federalism is very good for country.
Public participation always helps.
Once we decide to change even one aspect in the districts, we will get the momentum to work on the other shortcomings.
We have the manpower, we have the skills and the resources.

Business leaders,
My Singaporean Friends,
Members of Indian diaspora in Singapore,
Namaskar to all of you!
It is the grace and majesty, and the roar, of the two lions.
It is always a pleasure to return to Singapore.
It is a city that never fails to inspire.
Singapore may be a small island, but its horizons are global.
This great nation has shown us that size is no barrier to the scale of achievements or the strength of a nation’s voice in the world.
And, in this wonderful mosaic, there is an ancient thread, beautiful and colourful, that binds India and Singapore.
The course of India’s centuries-old route to South East Asia also ran through Singapore.
The human link is deep and enduring.
It lives in the Singaporean Indians.
And, this evening has been lit-up with your presence, your energy, your talent and your achievements.
Here in Singapore, you represent the diversity of India.
If you want to see all festivals of India in one city, or celebrate them for weeks, Singapore is the place to visit.
That might also be true now for Indian food!
I still remember the dinner Prime Minister Lee hosted for me in Little India.
Tamil is an official language here.
But, it is a testimony to Singapore’s spirit that school children can also learn five other Indian languages.
The city throbs with the finest of Indian culture.
And, in 2017, International Day of Yoga was held at 70 centres in this city.
That makes it one centre for every 10 square kilometres.
No other city in the world could have this Yogic intensity.
Institutions like Sri Ramakrishna Mission and Sri Narayana Mission have been here for decades.
In their service to society, without distinction between people, reflect the values that bind India and Singapore.
The moment which underlines even today the timeless and universal values of Mahatma Gandhi.
Political relations between India and Singapore are among the warmest and closest.
There are no contests or claims, or doubts.
It is a natural partnership from a shared vision.
Our defence relations are among the strongest, for both.
They are marking their Silver Jubilee now.
We are proud to host Singapore’s Army and Air Force for training in India.
Our ships regularly visit each other.
Many of you have been on board our naval ships.
I, too, am looking forward to visiting a Singapore Navy Ship and an Indian Naval Ship at the Changi Naval Base day after tomorrow.
In international forums, we speak in one voice in the cause of a rules-based order, sovereign equality of all nations, and free and open pathways of commerce and engagement.
Economics is the heart-beat of the relationship.
It is a partnership at the front-line of India’s global engagement.
Singapore is both a leading investment source and destination for India.
Singapore was the first country with which we signed a Comprehnsive Economic Cooperation Agreement.
So, India and Singapore are contributing to each other’s prosperity.
And, now we are building new partnerships for the digital world.
They will be the bridge of innovation and enterprise between India, Singapore and ASEAN.
Even in a year of deep structural reforms like the introduction of Goods and Services Tax, we remain the fastest growing major economy of the world.
And we intend to stay that-way.
Our economy has become more stable.
Fiscal deficit is down.
Current account deficit is comfortable.
The currency is stable.
And, the foreign exchange reserves are at a record high.
In India, the present is changing rapidly.
A ‘New India’ is taking shape.
And, there are many reasons for it.
One, Economic reforms are taking place at a speed and a scale not known so far.
Over 10,000 measures by Central and state governments in the last two years have helped us move up 42 places in the Ease of Doing Business rankings.
Over 1,400 out-dated laws have been repealed.
India is among the most open economies in the world.
Foreign investors can go into almost all sectors, often with up to 100% equity.
This was not an easy task.
But, it was done successfully.
And, it has created new economic opportunities.
Our personal income tax base has also expanded by nearly 20 million.
Three, our infrastructure sector is expanding at record speed.
Pace of rail track addition has doubled.
Other projects include 10 green field airports; five new major ports; 111 rivers designated as National Water-ways; and over 30 logistics parks.
We added over 80 thousand mega-watts of power in just three years.
And, in renewable energy, we have become the sixth largest producer in the world.
That is our commitment to a green and sustainable future.
Quite simply, the biggest infrastructure story of the world is unfolding in India.
Four, our manufacturing sector is rebounding.
There has been a sharp rise in FDI in the past three years – from 36 billion U.S.dollars in 2013-14 to 60 billion U.S.dollars in 2016-17.
There is also special focus on the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Sector.
In the course of the past three years, we have opened 316 million bank accounts for those who never had a bank account.
Now, 99% of Indian house-holds have a bank account.
Government benefits worth more than 50 billion U.S. dollars have been transferred directly to the beneficiaries.
They now have access to affordable pensions and insurance – everything that was once only a dream.
Now here in the world has banking expansion taken place on such a scale and at such speed.
Six, a digital revolution is sweeping through India.
For example, digital transactions are growing rapidly.
In 2017, just the UPI-based transactions grew seven thousand percent.
In January, all digital transactions were valued at 2 trillion U.S. dollars.
One of the exhibitors today is from one of these labs.
Seven, India will experience the largest wave of urbanisation in the world over the next two decades.
Eight, we are investing in skills and raising the standards of higher education to give a life of dignity and opportunity for our 800 million youth.
With learning from Singapore, we are setting up advanced Institutes of Skill Development.
And, in this fiscal year, we have launched a 15 billion U.S. dollar programme, to further strengthen our higher education system.
Nine, Agriculture sector is receiving a level of priority that it has not since the Green Revolution decades ago.
We aim to double the income of farmers by 2022, when Independent India will be 75 and a ‘New India’ will be born.
For this, we are using technology, remote sensing, internet, digital financial system, soft credit, insurance, soil health improvement, irrigation, pricing and connectivity.
Ten, we want every citizen to enjoy what I call ‘Ease of Living’ by 2022.
It means, for example, 50 million new houses so that there is roof over every head in 2022.
Last month, we reached a milestone.
Each one of our 600 thousand villages are now connected to a power grid.
We are also working to provide electric connection to every household.
We have launched this year AYUSHMAN Bharat, the National Health Insurance Scheme.
It will cover 100 million families or 500 million Indians with annual coverage of 8000 U.S. dollars.
This is simply the largest healthcare scheme in the world.
Quality of life is also linked to clean and sustainable development.
It is rooted in our heritage and our commitment to the planet’s future.
That is also driving change in governance and politics.
There is complete clarity and confidence about the pace and direction of economic reforms in India.
We will make it easier and smoother to do business in India.
We will work for an open, stable and fair international trade regime.
We want to see a comprehnsive fair, balanced agreement that lifts up all nations on the tide of trade and investment.
In conclusion For Singapore, there is no better opportunity than India.
This evening tells us that we are on the right path.
The two lions shall step into the future together.

Chairman, ASEAN Business Advisory Council;
At the onset, I apologise for the delay.
In business, like in politics, both time and timing are very important.
But sometimes despite our best efforts we cannot help it.
I am delighted to be here in Manila, on my very first visit to the Philippines.
• We have large, young and aspiring populations that are innovative and enterprising.
• The Philippines is a services power house just as India is.
This morning we witnessed a brilliant performance of the dance drama ‘Rama Hari’ based on the Ramayana at the Opening Ceremony of the ASEAN Summit.
It depicts the way historically the people of India and ASEAN have been bound together.
The Act East policy of my government puts this region at the centre of our engagement.
We have exceptionally good political and people-to-people relations with each and every country in the ASEAN region.
We wish to bring our economic and business relations up to the same level.
The task of transforming India is proceeding on an unprcedented scale.
We are working day and night to ensure Good Governance which includes easy, effective and transparent Governance.
To give you an example: we have started open auction for natural resources including telecom spectrum, coal mines and other minerals and even private radio channels.
We are using our Unique ID system in financial transactions and taxation for this purpose and the results are already visible.
These steps, coupled with demonetization of high value notes has resulted in formalizing a large part of our economy.
The number of new tax payers filing income tax returns has more than doubled.
We have used technology to reach out to people.
An online citizen engagement platform, MyGov has harnessed ideas, suggestions and inputs on policies and programmes from 2 million pro-active citizens.
In keeping with our emphasis on minimum government and maximum governance, 1200 out-dated laws have been repealed in three years.
New laws and institutions for Bankruptcy and Insolvency as well as IPR and Arbitration are now in place.
36 white industries have been taken out from the requirement of environmental clearance.
Incorporating a company is now just a one day affair.
We have simplified industrial licensing, and introduced online application process for environmental and forest clearances.
All these have made opening a new business very easy.
The results are obvious .
Most of the sectors of our economy are now open for FDI.
More than 90 per cent FDI sectors are on automatic approval route.India has emerged as a front-runner in attracting foreign direct investment.
Compared to last three years, we have received 67 per cent more FDI in this year.
Now, we are a globally integrated economy.
Moreover, these mile-stones have been achieved even before some of the major recent reforms.
This year in July, we have implemented the highly complex task of migrating to a uniform Goods and Services Tax for the whole country.
This has done away with a vast range of State level and central level taxes through-out India.
Friends, A very large part of India’s population had no access to banking services.
197 million bank accounts were opened in one year.
Till August this year, 290 million such accounts have been opened in Indian banks.
Nearly 200 million Ru-pay cards were issued for easy cash-less transactions.
Access to banking services by the poor has also played a major role in tackling corruption in government.
More than 146 million people are receiving direct cash subsidies through bank accounts on cooking gas alone.
Today, the government is using Direct Benefit Transfers for 59 different schemes.
Subsidies worth nearly 10 billion US dollars are being directly transferred to the bank accounts of the intended beneficiaries.
Through this initiative, we are committed to transform India as a major player in the global value chain.
We want to make India a global manufacturing hub.
At the same time, we want our youth to be job creators; not just job seekers.
For this purpose, we have launched drives called Start up India and Stand up India.A major constraint in freeing up the entreprsing energy of small entrepreneurs is lack of collateral for finance.
For the first time in India, collateral-free loans have been dis-bursed to more than 90 million small entrepreneurs under the Mudra scheme.
Very near to the population of Philippines.
This is a recognition of the contribution of small entrepreneurs in the economy and to empower a person who has a work-able business idea but no collateral.
I see the importance being given to entrepreneur- -ship in the Philippines and in ASEAN region.
The ASEAN Mentor-ship for Entrepreneurs launched at this Summit is a commendable initiative that addresses another felt need of entrepreneurs.
Indeed, for the near future, South and South East Asia will be the growth engine of the world.
Hence, building connectivity with ASEAN is a key objective for India.
We wish to build land, sea and air connectivity to this dynamic region.
Work is already on in the construction of the tri-lateral highway through Myanmar and Thailand to connect to other countries in South East Asia.
Out-bound tourism from India is growing at one of the fastest rates in the world.
Given the primacy of connectivity, India is organising an ASEAN – India Connectivity Summit in New Delhi next month with Ministers, officials and business representativs from all ASEAN countries participating.Just as India sees business opportunities in the region, I am sure that the ASEAN business community recognises the potential for business in India.
While some of you are already deeply involved in India, others are just discovering the possibilities that remain to be tapped.
To co-incide with the ASEAN –India Comme–morative Summit of ASEAN leaders in January next year, we are also organising the ASEAN-India Business and Investment Meet and Expo.
India wishes to participate in your growth story and we invite all of ASEAN to participate in ours.

Sanskrit language & literature encompasses a storehouse of knowledge pertaining to every facet of life.
And that is why the minutest nuance of an expression or subject can be accurately described.
This has been the core speciality of Sanskrit.Today, at times, in order to communicate more assertively, we tend to make use of English Quotations or even sher-o-shayari-urdu poetry.
But those who are well acquainted with Sanskrit Subhashitas – epigrammatic verses, know very well that it is possible to make a crisp, precise statement, using very few words through the usage of subhashitas.
And since there is a sense of geographical &cultural belonging, they are easy to understand & assimilate.
For example, in order to illustrate the significance of the Guru in one’s life, it has been said
Thereby meaning, when a guru imparts even an iota of knowledge to the student, there is no material or wealth on the entire earth that the student can make use of, to repay the guru.

Irrespective of age group or area of work, people are contributing.
Everyone is trying to ensure speedy mitigation of the sufferings people in Kerala are going through, in fact sharing their pain.

I would like to specially mention the arduous endeavors of the NDRF daredevils.
At this moment of hardship&agony, their service stands out as a shining example.
The capability, commitment & controlling situation through rapid decisions of the NDRF have made them a cynosure of every Indian’s eye, worthy of respect & admiration.
Yesterday was the festival of Onam.
We pray for Onam to provide strength to the country, especially Kerala so that it returns to normalcy on a newer journey of development.

During these last days, many great aspects of Atalji came up to the fore.
People remembered him as the best member of Parliament, sensitive writer, best orator and most popular Prime Minister and will continue to remember him.
The country will ever remain grateful to Atalji for bringing good governance in the main stream.
This change brought about two important changes in India’s politics.
First one is that the size of the cabinet in states was restricted to 15% of the total seats in the state Assembly.
It could only be a visionary like Atalji who brought in this transformation and as a result of this, healthy traditions blossomed in our polity.
Atalji was a true patriot.
It was during his tenure that the timing of presenting the budget was changed.
In the year 2001, Atalji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 am.
One more freedom-the Indian Flag Code was framed in Atalji’s tenure and it came into effect in 2002.
A number of such rules have been included in this code which made it possible to unfurl the tricolor in public places.
This provided a chance to more and more of our countrymen to unfurl our national flag.
Thus, he brought our beloved tricolor closer to the commonman.
You must have noticed how Atalji took bold steps to bring about fundamental reforms, whether in our election process or about the shortcomings concerning the people’s representatives.
Similarly, you can see that presently efforts are afoot and discussions are being held about simultaneously holding the elections for Lok Sabha and for state assemblies.
The Government and the opposition – both are putting forth their view points.
This is a good development and a healthy sign for our democracy.
I must say that developing healthy traditions for a sound democracy, making constant efforts to strengthen democracy, encouraging open-minded debates would also be aappropriate tribute to Atalji.
Reiterating our resolve to fulfill his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I along with all of you pay tributes to Atalji.
The monsoon session of Parliament ended just a few days back.
You will be glad to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha remained 118 percent and that of Rajya Sabha was 74 percent.
All the members rose above party interests to make the Monsoon session most productive and this is why Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and in Rajya Sabha fourteen bills were passed.
This Monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session for social justice and youth welfare.
A number of importantbills beneficial to the youth and the backward classes were passed during this session.
As you know, a demand to constitute an OBC Commission similar to SC/ST commission was long pending for decades.
The country fulfilled its resolve this time to make an OBC Commission and also granted it Constitutional powers.
This step will prove to be the one to move forward our march towards achieving the goal of social justice.
An amendment bill to secure the rights of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes also were passed in this session.
This Act will give more security to the interests of SC and ST communities.
This will also forbid criminals from indulging in atrocities and will instill confidence among the dalit communities.
No civil society can tolerate any kind of injustice towards the woman-power of the country.
Recently, you might have read in newspapers, that a court in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, after a brief hearing of two months, pronounced the death sentence on two criminals found guilty of raping a minor girl.
Earlier, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh awarded the death sentence to the guilty after a hearing of just five days.
Courts in Rajasthan have also taken similar quick decisions.
This Act will play an effective role in curbing crimes against women and girls.
Economic growth will be incomplete without a social transformation.
When we move ahead in the national interest, a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived ones can also be brought about.
In the Monsoon session, this time, everyone jointly presented an ideal approach.
Today, I publicly express my heartfelt gratitude to all MP’s.
Every morning, first of all, people look for newspapers, Television, News and Social Media to check Indian playerswinning medals.
The Asian Games are going on.
I wish to congratulate all players who have won medals for the country.
I extend my best wishes to thoseplayers who are yet to compete.
Indian players are performing exceedingly well in shooting and wrestling but our players are winning medals in those competitions too, in which our performance has not been so good earlier-like WUSHU and ROWING.
These are not just medals but an evidence of the sky high spirits of the Indian players.
This too is a very positive indication that most of the medal-winners hail from small towns and villages and these players have achieved this success by putting in sheer hard work.
We shall celebrate National Sports Day on 29th August and I extend my best wishes to all sport lovers and also pay my tributes to the legendary hockey wizard Shri Dhyanchandji.
I request every citizen to make it a point to play and take care of their fitness because only a healthy India will build a developed and prosperous India.
When India will be fit, only then India’s future will be bright.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners at the Asian Games and also wish the remaining players perform well.
Many good wishes to you all on the National Sports Day.
Would you believe if someone tells you that about a thousand years ago, an over sixty metrestall pillar of granite was built and anothergranite rock weighing about 80 tonnes was placed over its top.
But, Brihdeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unbelievable combination of Engineering and Architecture can be seen.
Anybody will feel overawed on seeing Rani Ki Vaav of the 11th Century in Patan in Gujarat.
Our land has been an engineering laboratory.
There have been several engineers in India who made the unimaginable possible and presented such marvels of engineering before the world.
Lakhs of farmers and common people continue to benefit from the Krishna Raj Sagar Dam built by him.
He is greatly revered in that part of our country and the whole nation remembers him with great respect and regard.
In his memory, 15th September is observed as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, our engineers have created their own identity in the world.
When I talk of wonders in the Engineering world, I am reminded of an incident of 2001 when a devastating earth quake hit Kutch in Gujarat.
And she was looking at me and mockingly,saying, “Look at my house.
But, you did not find any damage anywhere.
Nowadays, disaster management has assumed immense significance.
We will keep meeting through Mann Ki Baat, and will keep sharing matters close to our hearts.
We will join hands in taking our country forward with heartfelt vigor.
With these feelings, I extend my best wishes to you all.

He laid the foundation stone for national highway projects, and the Pendra-Anuppur 3rd railway line.
The Prime Minister also handed over certificates etc to select beneficiaries of various welfare schemes of the Union and State Governments.
It is due to his vision of development that all these states are progressing rapidly, the Prime Minister said.
We are committed to development for all, the Prime Minister asserted, noting that the Union Government wants to ensure a roof over every head by 2022.
The Prime Minister said that the task of constructing toilets was undertaken in mission mode.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today released a commemorative postage stamp on former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Late Shri Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna.

The Prime Minister also spoke at length about Shri Bahuguna’s contributions in the education sector, and development in the hilly areas of the country.
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to this meeting with the BRICS Business Council.
The Council reflects the full economic diversity and depth of business engagement between our countries.
I thank their contribution to the BRICS agenda of building inclusive economies through responsive and collective solutions.
It is, therefore, encouraging to see the BRICS Business Council take healthy shape three years after we set it up in Durban.
Our business communities are the strongest proponents for closer and faster commercial cooperation among BRICS.
Their partnerships create wealth and value in our societies.
And, enhance productivity and create jobs in our economies through technological innovations and capacity addition.
I applaud that vision.
In India, we have undertaken substantial reforms in the last two years to streamline and simplify governance, especially doing business in India.
The results are clearly visible.
We have moved up in almost all global indices that measure such performances.
We have transformed India into one of the most open economies in the world today.
Growth is strong and we are taking steps to keep the momentum going.
I am happy to note that the BRICS Business Council also has matching priorities of ease of doing business, dismantling trade barriers, promoting skills development, establishing manufacturing supply chains and infrastructure development.
The Council’s work holds much promise for expansion of trade and business among BRICS countries.
The New Development Bank is fully operational now.
Its success is a concrete result of our common efforts.
We congratulate the NDB and its management for commencing the first batch of projects.
NDB has kept clean energy and green and sustainable infrastructure as its priority.
We welcome it.
We would encourage the BRICS Business Council to work closely with the NDB on identifying and implementing prospective economic projects.
India hosted the First BRICS Trade Fair in New Delhi two days ago with active participation from all your countries.
Such activities must be promoted to generate greater business awareness and commercial exchanges.
In a little while, we will hear from the BRICS Business Council and the leadership of NDB.
My dear brothers and sisters present here in large numbers,
My regards to the people of Mokama.
I convey my regards to all of you on this holy land of Lord Parashuram.
I am blessed on coming here in Mokama.
The whole country is gearing up to celebrate Diwali.
Preparations for Chhath Puja are also underway.
Brothers and sisters, a short while ago Gadkari Ji was talking about how many road projects, highway projects have been started by the government of India.
And description was so long that I saw that you too were surprised that so many schemes can be implemented in such a short span of time to turn around the fortune of Bihar.
I am grateful to Nitish Ji and his entire team for supporting all the government of India schemes in every possible manner.
And I respect his feelings and I assure him that the government of India would walk with him shoulder to shoulder to realise the dreams of millions and millions of people of Bihar and it will take the journey of development to new heights.
He showed me the model and I am confident this kind of bridge will become the centre of attraction for the entire Bihar.
And this bridge will connect Begusarai, the area of work of the first chief minister of Bihar Dr. Shri Krishna, with the state capital Patna.
Even today, I bow down to Shri Babu who made Begusarai the industrial capital of Bihar by establishing Refinery, Fertilizer, Thermal Power Plant and Barauni Dairy.
They show us the path of liberty from the blind faith.
Brothers and sisters, this land is also the land where lord Parashuram had meditated.
Nobody can forget the grand history of the holy Simaria Bank located on the banks of mother Ganga at the confluence of three great ancient states – Ang, Magadh and Mithila.
And when I have got the good opportunity to bow down to this holy Simaria Bank from this platform then I respectfully bow down to it.
This is the land of brave-heart Babha Chauharmal, a fair is being organised in his memory every year at some distance from here.
A large crowd gathers here and I also bow down to such a holy land.
And they have been facing the heat under the sun for quite some time and despite suffering this hardship they have turned up here in large numbers to bless me, I bow down to you as well.
I welcome you.
But my dear brothers and sisters of Bihar, I would like to assure you that the government of India and the state government will not allow the hardships faced by you people here to go waste.
Our country also had this kind of people whose thinking was responsible for the backwardness of the country.
I have read about this kind of politicians who used to talk like this if someone talked about constructing a road: ‘What is the need for a road, the roads are needed by those who have cars, do we poor people have cars, why do we need roads?’
The people with this kind of negative mentality, we cannot even think about the way they have ruined the country.
If today you travel to a village where there is no road….MPs also come to meet me and they tell me that some roads under the Pradhanmantri Gram Sadak Yojna have not been constructed in their area, they ask me to give priority to their area.
Whenever people from rural areas meet me they demand the roads under the Pradhanmantri Gram Sadak Yojna.
Brothers and sisters, Ganga, our lives are dependent on her.
Today, if mother Ganga were not there then how terrible the situation would have been?
However, we never made any attempt to save that Ganga, we were indifferent.
Saving the Ganga is equal to saving our future generations.
A campaign has been launched to stop the drainage of polluted water, to stop the water polluted with chemicals going into Ganga.
And today foundation stones for several projects are being laid simultaneously in Bihar so that in the coming days we will be able to see mother Ganga the same way the way we have devotion for her.
We have made this arrangement that the poorest of the poor can board the train at the last moment without reservation.
We have connected Mahamana Express from Baroda to Banaras.
People who have been working in Surat, in Baroda and in Ankaleshwar, people those who work in Maharashtra can reach their homes comfortably for the festivals of Diwali and Chhath Puja.
This government has started these four important trains in the last few days at a very fast pace to connect Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh, it is certainly going to benefit you people during Diwali and Chhath Puja.
Brothers and sisters, a short while ago Nitin Ji, Gadkari Ji presented a sketch to you, perhaps, this kind of massive work of building infrastructure in such a short span of time would never have been done in Bihar before.
As Nitin Ji just said that in case of the work of roads alone, the work worth Rs. 53,000 crore has either been started or has been approved.
These issues of connectivity are related to poor people and even in these things a project of waterways has been launched under the leadership of our Gadkari Ji.
And if we successfully implement waterways then you will see the importance of rivers.
Those people who are from the economic field even they won’t be able to resist the need to associate themselves with the rivers with a feeling of reverence.
This kind of change is going to be come about in the field of the country’s economy due to the waterways to supply the goods to the poorest of the poor in the least possible expenses.
This thing is going to become possible on the banks of the mother river due to waterways.
In the British era this waterway was there, at that time Mokama was known as Mini Calcutta.
You must have seen that we have started a massive campaign to provide electricity to those villages where it was not available.
Brothers and sisters, we have decided that no Indian family will be compelled to live in the 18th century like situation.
Brothers and sisters, this is a unique feature of this government which even our critics have to admit after these three years.
It was a habit of previous governments to make announcements while keeping the elections in mind and then to forget the people and the schemes.
Today, there is this kind of government in Delhi that we prepare the road map of a scheme if we conceive it.
And the government completely dedicates itself in arranging those resources, in implementing those schemes in a time bound manner to finish them during its tenure.
You might have seen that the gas connections to more than 3 crore families, to the poor families, to the poorest of the poor families have been provided so far.
They have started cooking chapattis on gas stove.
We have started off with the cleanliness campaign.
Today, we have linked five crore families in the country with toilets.
And I assure you that the government of India is committed for the development of eastern India.
And under the development model followed by us, be it eastern Uttar Pradesh, be it Bihar or West Bengal or Assam or Odisha or be it North East, all these regions will scale new heights of development.
We have been working in the direction of setting up a fertiliser plant in your area.
Our farmers are going to get benefit from that.
And with this single expectation that all of you will join this journey of development I call upon all of you to join me in saying this with your full strength:
(Bharat Mata Ki Jay) Victory for Mother India,
“Congratulations to Manohar Parrikar and his team on being sworn in.

Through ‘Mann Ki Baat’, I once again have been blessed with the opportunity to be face-to-face with you.
I am sure you distinctly remember that for the last many months, a naval team comprising six women Commanders was on a voyage.
They traversed a multitude of oceans, many a sea, over a distance of almost twenty two thousand nautical miles.
This was a first of its kind event in the entire world.
Last Wednesday, I got an opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate these daughters and their spirit of adventure for bringing laurels to the country, for raising the glory of the Navy and significantly so, for conveying to the world that India’s daughters are no less.
Who does not know of the sense of adventure?
The number of such people may be miniscule, but they turn out to be sources of inspiration for millions of others, spanning an array of eras.
Recently, you must have come across quite a few notable happenings pertaining to mountaineers attempting to scale Mount Everest.
On the 16th of May, a team comprising five tribal students of an Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra- Maneesha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madhavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam- scaled the world’s highest peak.
These Ashram School students began training in August, 2017, covering Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh.
These young boys & girls had been selected under ‘Mission Shaurya’.
True to its name, they brought glory to the country with their brave deed of conquering the Everest.
I congratulate these young friends and members of the school in Chandrapur, from the core of my heart.
Just a while ago, 16 year old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to scale Everest from the Nepal side.
Heartiest congratulations, Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter became the first ever father-daughter duo to ascend Everest.
When I say ‘Fit India’, I believe that the more we play, the more we will inspire the country to come out & play.
People are sharing videos of Fitness Challenge on social media; they are tagging each other to spread the challenge.
Everybody is now getting connected with this Fit India Campaign.
People from the film fraternity, from the world of Sports, common citizens of the country, members of the armed forces, school teachers or even those toiling in fields and farms, their rising notes are building up a crescendo ‘Hum Fit toh India Fit’… ‘If we are fit, India is fit’.
For me, it’s heartwarming that the captain of the Indian Cricket team Virat Kohli ji has included me in his challenge… and I too have accepted his challenge.
I believe this is gainful and this kind of a challenge will inspire us to be fit alongwith others, as well.
My dear countrymen, many a time in ‘Mann Ki Baat’, you must have heard me mention a thing or two about sports & sportspersons.
Some games saw the participation of the whole family.
The unity, intrinsic to our country’s diversity can be witnessed in these games.
A single game is known by distinct names at different places.
It is played with cowries or tamarind seeds or dice on an eight by eight square board.
It used to be played in almost every state.
One realizes after playing, despite not knowing the language of a particular state, “Oh!
We used to play this game in our state as well!”
Who amongst us would not have enjoyed playing Gilli-Danda in our childhood?
This is a game that is played across villages and cities.
It is also known by different names.
Some games are seasonal.
There is a season for flying kites.
While flying a kite or playing a game, one freely expresses one’s inherent unique qualities.
You must have seen many a child, shy by nature, leap up with zest, the moment a game begins.
Even children with a seemingly serious countenance start expressing themselves; while playing, the innate child within them comes to the fore.
Traditional sports and games are structured in such a manner that along with physical ability, they enhance our logical thinking, concentration, alertness and energy levels.
Games are not just games; they teach us values in life, such as, setting targets, building up determination, developing team spirit and fostering mutual co-operation.
From tiny tots to Grandfather-Grandmother, when we all play these games together then the term ‘Generation Gap’ disappears on its own.
At the same time, we also come to know about our culture and traditions.
Many games also make us aware about our society, environment and other spheres.
I appeal to all of you, that while trying to understand the importance of this theme, we should all ensure that we do not use low grade polythene and low grade plastics and try to curb the negative impact of plastic pollution on our environment, on our wild life and our health.
Let us all visit the World Environment Day website ‘wed-india 2018’ and try to imbibe and inculcate the many interesting suggestions given there into our everyday life.
Whenever we face a torrid summer, or floods, incessant rains or unbearable cold, everybody becomes an expert, analyzing global warming and climate change.
But does empty talk bring about any solutions?
Being sensitive towards nature, protecting nature, should come naturally to us; these virtues should be embedded in our sanskar.
There was also loss of life and property.
These calamities are basically the result of the change in weather patterns.
Our culture, our traditions have never taught us to be at loggerheads with nature.
We have to live in harmony and in synchronicity with nature, we have to stay in touch with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this wisdom at every step of his life.
Today when India speaks of climate justice or plays a major role in the Cop21 and Paris agreements or when we unite the whole world through the medium of International Solar Alliance, they all are rooted in fulfilling that very dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this environment day, let all of us give it a good thought as to what can we do to make our planet cleaner and greener?
The 21stof June has been mandated and is celebrated as the International Yoga Day in the entire world and people start preparing for it months in advance.
Thisobservation expressed centuries ago, straightaway implies that practicing yogic exercises on a regular basis leads to imbibing benefic attributes which stand by our side like relatives and friends.
The practice of yoga leads to building up of courage, which always protects us like a father.
Bhartahari has said that with regular yogic exercise, truth becomes our child, mercy becomes our sister, self restraint our brother, earth turns in to our bed and knowledge satiates our hunger.
When so many attributes become one’s partner, then that yogi conquers all forms of fear.
Once again, I appeal to all the citizens to adopt their legacy of yoga and create a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
I render my pranam to Pandit ji.
In many parts of the country, our youth and farmers demonstrated their bravery whilst standing up against the injustice.
It is indeed sad that we kept on calling the events of 1857 only as a rebellion or a soldiers’ mutiny for a very long time.
In fact, May 1857 was not only evaluated as a minor historical incident but was also an attempt to dent our self-respect.
It was Veer Savarkar who boldly expostulated by writing that whatever happened in 1857 was not a revolt but was indeed the First War of Independence.
Savarkaralong with his band of brave hearts celebrated the 50thanniversary of the First War of Independence with great fanfare at India house in London.
It is also an amazing coincidence that the month which witnessed the First Struggle for Independence was the month in which Veer Savarkar ji was born.
Savarkar ji’s personality was full of special qualities; he was a worshipper of both weapons or shashtra and Knowledge or shaashtras.
Generally Veer Savarkar is renowned for his bravery and his struggle against the British Raj.
But besides these sterling qualities, he was also a striking poet and a social reformer who always emphasized on goodwill and unity.
A wonderful account about Savarkarji has been given by our dear honorable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
What an accurate depiction of Savarkar by Atal ji!
Savarkar marched alongwith both poetry and revolution.
Our daughters, who were forced to sift through garbage and beg from home to home in order to earn a living – today they are learning sewing and stitching clothes to cover the impoverished.
This is an example where the daughters are stitching ordinary to good quality clothes for themselves and other families.
Along with this, they are undergoing a training course in skill development.
I wish all these daughters, brimming with hope and trust, a very bright future.
If you observe in your neighbourhood, then you will witness for yourselves how people overcome the difficulties in their lives!
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, and enjoy tea there, a discussion with some of the customers automatically ensues.
But there are some people who go ahead with their work, to bring about a change through their hard work and dedication; they make it a reality.
Shriman D. Prakash Rao has been a tea vendor in the city of Cuttack forthe past five decades.
A meagre tea vendor; today you will be surprised to know that the lives of more than 70 children are being illuminated through education due to his efforts.
He ensures education, health and meals for all the children coming to this school.
His life is an inspiration to us, our society and the whole country.
Your surroundings too must be full of such inspiring happenings.
There must be innumerable incidents.
Come, let us take positivity forward.
The month of June is so hot that people anxiously wait for the rains, gazing towards the sky for the clouds to appear.
People will wait for the moon in a few days from now onwards.Witnessing the moon means that the festival of Eid can be celebrated.
After an entire month of fasting during Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a harbinger of celebrations.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
We shall meet once again in another episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ next month.

This university is a testimony to the vision of a great generation of Indians.
Now, we have launched yet another revolution of empowerment and opportunities in India.
And, we are once again turning to our scientists and innovators to realize our goals of human welfare and economic development.
For him, the highest purpose of science was the transformation of the life of the weak, the under-privileged and the youth.
And, his life’s mission was a self-reliant and a self-assured India that was strong and cared for its people.
Your theme for this Congress is a fitting tribute to his vision.
And, it is leaders like Professor Rao and President Kalam, and scientists like you, who have placed India at the forefront of science and technology in many areas.
Our success spans from the core of the tiny atom to the vast frontier of space.
Our digital networks are expanding the quality and reach of public services and social benefits for the poor.
And, in the first ever National Space Conference, we identified 170 applications that touch almost every aspect of governance, development and conservation.
And, I have asked for a framework of Scientific Audit for scientific departments and institutions in the government.
It is with the same spirit of cooperative federalism that is shaping centre-state relations in every area, that I am encouraging greater scientific collaboration between Central and State institutions and agencies.
We will also try to increase the level of resources for science, and deploy them in accordance with our strategic priorities,
We will make it easier to do science and research in India, improve science administration, and expand the supply and improve the quality of science education and research in India.
In 2015, the world took two historic steps.
Last September, the United Nations adopted the Development Agenda for 2030.
And, last November in Paris, the world came together to craft a historic agreement to change the course of our planet.
But, we achieved something else that is equally important.
We succeeded in bringing innovation and technology to the heart of the climate change discourse.
We were consistent in our message that it is not enough to speak of targets and restraints.
It is essential to find solutions that help us transition easily to a future of clean energy.
We pledged to double national investments in innovation; and, build a global partnership that combines the responsibility of governments with the innovative capacity of the private sector.
This is especially critical for India to achieve our target of adding 175 GW of renewable generation by 2022.
We must also make fossil fuel like coal cleaner and more efficient.
And, we should tap newer sources of renewable energy, from ocean waves to geothermal energy.
So, at Paris, India launched an International Solar Alliance to forge a partnership between solar-rich countries.
We need science and technology not just to make clean energy an integral part of our existence, but also to combat the impact of climate change on our lives.
We have to develop climate resilient agriculture.
We must understand the impact of climate change on our weather, biodiversity, glaciers, and oceans; and, how to adjust to them.
This will be critical for a sustainable world.
For the first time in human history, we are in an urban century.
We must develop better scientific tools to improve city planning with sensitivity to local ecology and heritage; and, reduce the demand for transportation, improve mobility and reduce congestion.
Much of our urban infrastructure is yet to be built.
We must maximise the use of local material with scientific improvements; and, and make buildings more energy efficient.
And, we need solutions that are comprehensive and rooted in science and innovation.
That is why, in the past year, we have increased our focus on ocean or blue economy.
We will raise the level of our scientific efforts in marine science.
We will set up an advanced centre of research in marine biology and biotechnology and establish a network of coastal and island research stations in India and abroad.
We have entered into agreements on marine science and ocean economy with several countries.
The success of one-sixth of humanity will also mean a more prosperous and a sustainable future for the world.
We can only do this with your leadership and support.
Empathy – when our efforts are in tune with our culture, circumstances and social challenges.
Equity – when science advances inclusive development and improves the welfare of the weakest.
This year we mark a hundred years of a significant moment in the history of science, when Albert Einstein published in 1916 “The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity”.
Today, we must recall the humanism that defined his thought: “Concern for man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavours. “
Nothing can be a higher duty for us, whether we are in public life, or we are private citizens, and whether we are in business or explore science, than to leave the planet in a better state for our future generations.
The Prime Minister reviewed the progress towards handling and resolution of grievances related to Railways.
Noting that a large number of complaints were related to corrupt practices of officials, he directed strictest possible action against Railway officials found guilty of corruption.

He said that the visit re-energised the strategic partnership between the two countries.
He deeply appreciated the support being extended by India for infrastructure development and capacity building in Afghanistan.
The two leaders shared views on further deepening the strategic partnership, both in the bilateral and regional context.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today delivered the inaugural address at the 106th session of the Indian Science Congress.
He recalled the great Indian scientists of the past, including Acharyas J.C. Bose, C.V. Raman, Meghnad Saha, and S.N. Bose, and said that they served the people through “minimum resources” and “maximum struggle.”
“The life and works of hundreds of Indian Scientists are a compelling testament of integration of deep fundamental insights with technology development and nation-building.
It is through our modern temples of science that India is transforming its present and working to secure its future,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister recalled our former Prime Ministers Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri ji and Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
He said that now the time has come to take a step further, by adding “Jai Anusandhan.”
The Prime Minister emphasized that the pursuit of science is fulfilled through the achievement of two objectives: generation of profound or disruptive knowledge; and use of that knowledge for socio-economic good.
More Technology Business Incubators have been established in the last four years than in the forty years before that, he added.
“Our Scientists must commit themselves to addressing problems of affordable healthcare, housing, clean air, water and energy, agricultural productivity and food processing.
While Science is universal, technology must be local for providing solutions relevant to local needs and conditions,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that big data analysis, artificial intelligence, block-chain etc should be utilised in the agricultural sector, especially to help the farmers with relatively small farm-holdings.
The Prime Minister mentioned major achievements of Indian science in 2018, including:
He said that strong pathways to commercialization, are needed to leverage our Research & Development achievements, through industrial products.
The Prime Minister called for research, which is a fusion of Arts and Humanities, Social Science, Science and Technology.
Speaking on achievements in the space sector, the Prime Minister mentioned the success of Cartosat 2 and other satellites.
He said preparations are underway for sending three Indians into space, through the Gaganyaan in 2022.
He expressed happiness that research has begun to find an effective solution for sickle cell anaemia.
He said that the ‘Prime Minister’s Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council’ will help formulate appropriate Science and Technology interventions, catalyze collaborations across stakeholder Ministries and implement multi-stakeholder policy initiatives.
We have launched the ‘Prime Minister’s Research Fellows’ Scheme under which, a thousand bright minds from the best Institutions in the country will be offered direct admission in Ph.D. Programs in IITs and IISc, the Prime Minister said.
In a few hours, we will be ushering in the new year of 2017.
125 crore Indians will join the rest of the world, in welcoming it with new hope, new energy and new dreams.
Since Diwali, our nation has been witness to a historic rite of purification.
The patience, discipline, and resolve displayed by 125 crore Indians, will play a critical role in shaping the future of the nation for years to come.
In God’s creation, humans are endowed with fundamental goodness.
With time, the distortions of badness creep in.
People feel suffocated in a bad environment, and struggle to come out of it.
Such collective energy and patriotism is under- standable, in the face of external threats.However, when crores of Indians unite to fight a war against internal evils, it is unparalleled.
We have lived these ideals.
125 crore Indians have shown, in their fortitude, the importance we place in truth and goodness.
They have shown that resolute honesty, can defeat dishonesty.
They have shown how much, even people trapped in poverty, are willing to do, to build a glorious India.
The people, through persistence, sweat and toil, have demonstrated to the world, an unparalleled example of citizen sacrifice, for the brighter future of a nation.
Usually, when people’s movements have arisen, the people and the government have been at loggerheads.
It is historic, that both the people and the government are on the same side in this battle against evil.
They have shared their pain and sorrow with me, but also emphasized their support.
You have talked to me as one of your own.
In this fight against corruption and black money, it is clear that you wish to walk shoulder to shoulder with us.
For us in Government, this is a blessing.
My effort is to take the banking system to normalcy as fast as possible in the new year.
I have asked all concerned officers in the Government to focus their attention to this task.
Economists agree that when cash is outside the formal economy, it is a cause of worry.When it joins the mainstream, it is an opportunity for development.
In the past few weeks, there have been many gratifying instances – it would take weeks to list them.
How long will we overlook facts that stare us in the face?
Can we digest this?
Look at the big bungalows and big cars around you.
If we look at any big city, it would have lakhs of people with annual income of more than 10 lakh.
Do you not feel, that for the good of the country, this movement for honesty, needs to be further strengthened?
In this fight against corruption and black money, it is natural to debate the fate of the dishonest.
What punishment will they get?
It is also a bitter truth, that people have complaints of bad experiences at the hands of Government machinery, and some government officers.
If we remain vigilant, we can now save our children from returning to those evil ways of violence and cruelty.
During this period, bank employees have worked day and night.
They will not be spared.
At this historic juncture, I wish to make an appeal to the banks.
India is celebrating the centenary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay as Garib Kalyan Varsh.
Banks should also not let this opportunity slip.
Friends, to further the principle of Sabka Saath – Sabka Vikaas, on the eve of the new year, Government is bringing some new programmes for the people.
Even so many years after independence, millions of poor do not have their own home.
Rabi sowing is up by 6 per cent compared to last year.
Fertilizer offtake is up by 9 per cent.
During this period, the Government has taken care to ensure that farmers do not suffer for want of access to seeds, fertilisers and credit.
Now, we have taken some more decisions in the interest of farmers.
The Government has decided, that 3 crore farmers who have Kisan Credit Cards, will be given RuPay debit cards within three months.
Kisan Credit Cards were launched in 1998, but so far, it was essential to go to a bank, to use them.
Now, farmers will have RuPay Debit Cards, which they can use anywhere.
Government has taken some decisions in the interest of small and medium businesses, which will also boost employment.
This decision will enable better access to credit for small shop-owners and small enterprises.
Banks and NBFCs will not levy high interest on these loans, as Government of India is bearing the cost of underwriting them.
Government has also asked banks to raise the credit limit for small industry from 20 per cent of turnover to 25 per cent.
Banks have also been asked to increase working capital loans from 20 per cent of turnover to 30 per cent, for enterprises that transact digitally.
Many people connected with this sector have made cash deposits in the last few weeks.
Banks have been asked to take this into account when deciding on working capital.
A few days back, Government announced a major tax relief for small businesses.
Income of businesses with turnover of up to Rs 2 crores was calculated at 8% of the turnover.
The progress of the MUDRA Yojana has been very encouraging.
Last year, nearly 3 and a half crore people have benefited from this.
6000 rupees will be transferred directly to the bank accounts of pregnant women who undergo institutional delivery and vaccinate their children.
This scheme will help reduce the maternal mortality rate, in a big way.
The time has now come that all political leaders and parties respect the feelings of the nation’s honest citizens, and understand the anger of the people.
It is true that from time to time, political parties have made constructive efforts to improve the system.
I urge all parties and leaders to move away from a “holier than thou approach,” to come together in prioritising transparency, and take firm steps to free politics of black money and corruption.
The time has come for this to be seriously considered and debated.
Positive change has always found space in our country.
We can now see a positive momentum towards digital transactions in India.
BHIM stands for Bharat Interface for Money.
I call upon the youth, the trading community, and farmers to connect with BHIM as much as possible.
In a short time, the new year of 2017 will begin.
Exactly 100 years ago, in 1917, Mahatma Gandhi initiated a Satyagraha in Champaran.
Now, a century later, we witness that the people of India continue to share that feeling towards truth and goodness.
The new dawn of the New Year, comes with the resolve of new success.
Let us all come together, to move ahead overcoming obstacles and constraints.

“Congratulations to Bajrang Punia for securing the Gold in Asian Wrestling Championship.
And, a platform to launch India’s defence manufacturing sector.
It can boost investment, expand manufacturing, support enterprise, raise the technology level and increase economic growth in the country.
In India, the defence industry in the government sector alone employs nearly 200,000 workers and thousands of engineers and scientists.
They produce an output of nearly 7 billion dollars annually.
But, it already employs thousands of people.
This is despite the fact that nearly 60% of our defence equipment continues to be imported.
And, we are spending tens of billions of dollars on acquisitions from abroad.
There are studies that show that even a 20 to 25% reduction in imports could directly create an additional 100,000 to 120,000 highly skilled jobs in India.
If we could raise the percentage of domestic procurement from 40% to 70% in the next five years, we would double the output in our defence industry.
Imagine the impact in terms of jobs created directly and in the related manufacturing and services sector!
We are reforming our defence procurement policies and procedures.
There would be a clear preference for equipment manufactured in India.
Our procurement procedures will ensure simplicity, accountability and speedy decision making.
Government’s support for research and development is essential for defence sector.
We must ensure that our tax system does not discriminate against domestic manufacture in comparison to imports.
More broadly, our defence industry will succeed more if we can transform the manufacturing sector in India.
We need great infrastructure, sound business climate, clear investment policies, ease of doing business, stable and predictable tax regime, and easy access to inputs.
Above all, we need a vast pool of highly skilled and qualified human resources for the defence industry.
Our aerospace industry alone would need about 200,000 people in another ten years.
India will also ask its experts to work with Nauru in repairing the mooring to ensure that the docking of ships at the harbor can take place in an effortless manner.

The annual Central financial liability on account of this measure would be about Rs. 9,800 crore.
For the State Govt. funded institutions, the revised pay scales will require adoption by the respective State Governments.
The Central Government will bear the additional burden of the States on account of revision of pay scales.
Chennai’s contribution to our rich culture is precious.
This is a proud moment for India.”
“Private participation either for complete provision of metro rail or for some unbundled components (like Automatic Fare Collection, Operation & Maintenance of services etc) will form an essential requirement for all metro ra il projects seeking central financial assistance” says the policy, to capitalize on private resources, expertise and entrepreneurship.
The new Metro Rail Policy provides for rigorous assessment of new metro proposals and proposes an independent third party assessment by agencies to be identified by the Government like the Institute of Urban Transport and other such Centres of Excellence whose capacities would be augmented, as required in this regard.
Under the policy, States need to adopt innovative mechanisms like Value Capture Financing tools to mobilize resources for financing metro projects by capturing a share of increase in the asset values through ‘Betterment Levy’.
States would also be required to enable low cost debt capital through issuance of corporate bonds for metro projects.
Metro Projects with a total length of 537 kms are in progress in 13 cities including the eight mentioned above.
New cities acquiring metro services are; Hyderabad (71 kms), Nagpur (38 kms), Ahmedabad (36 kms), Pune (31.25 kms) and Lucknow (23 kms).
Metro projects with a total length of 595 kms in 13 cities including 10 new cities are at various stages of planning and appraisal.

This is truly an esteemed gathering of spiritual leaders, scholars and leaders from several countries of the world where Buddhism is a prevalent way of life.
Yet, with age grew a distinct consciousness about human suffering, about illness, about old age and about death.
He was convinced that material wealth is not the sole goal.
The innermost being of man manifests godliness.
Nothing pained him more than mindless conflict that caused human suffering.
Non-violence was integral to his worldview.
The message and teachings of Gautama Buddha resonate loudly and clearly with the major themes chosen for this symposium– the themes of avoiding conflicts, moving towards environmental consciousness and a concept of free and frank dialogue.
The conflict in the first theme is among humans, religions, communities and nation-states, also between non-state actors and states, and even the world.
Ethical values of personal restraint in consumption and environmental consciousness are deeply rooted in Asian philosophical traditions, especially in Hinduism and Buddhism.
Buddhism, along with other faiths, such as Confucianism, Taoism and Shintoism, has undertaken greater responsibility to protect the environment.
Hinduism and Buddhism with their well-defined treatises on Mother Earth can help examine the changes in approach that need to be made.
Climate change is a pressing global challenge.
It calls for a collective human action and a comprehensive response.
In India, faith and Nature have had a deep link since ancient times.
Buddhism and environment are deeply co-related.
The Buddhist tradition, in all of its historical and cultural manifestations, encourages greater identification with the Natural world because from a Buddhist perspective nothing has a separate existence.
The impurities in the environment affect the mind, and the impurities of mind also pollute the environment.
In order to purify the environment, we have to purify the mind.
The eco crisis, in fact, is a reflection of imbalance of mind.
Lord Buddha, therefore, accorded importance to the need for preserving natural resources, and created tools related to water conservation and forbid the monks from polluting water resources.
The nature, forests, trees and the well-being of all beings play a great role in the teachings of Lord Buddha.
In my book I have shared my experiences of dealing with climate change as the Chief Minister.
Personally, it is my reading of Vedic literature that educated me about the strong bond between humans and Mother Nature.
We are all aware of Mahatma Gandhi’s Doctrine of Trusteeship.
In this context, I want to say that we, the present generation, have the responsibility to act as a trustee of the rich natural wealth for the future generations.
The issue is not merely about climate change; it is about climate justice.
Again I repeat is not the issue of climate change, it is about climate justice.
In my view, the most adversely affected by climate change are the poor and the downtrodden.
When a natural disaster strikes, they are hit the hardest.
When there are floods, they are rendered homeless; during a quake, their homes are destroyed; during droughts, they are affected; and during extreme cold too, the homeless suffer the most.
We can’t let climate change keep affecting people in this manner.
Which is why I believe the discourse must shift focus from climate change to climate justice.
The third theme — promotion of dialogue – calls for a shift from ideological approach to a philosophic one.
Without proper dialogue, neither of the two themes of conflict avoidance is possible, or workable.
The severe limitations in our conflict resolution mechanisms are becoming more and more obvious.
We need significant, collective and strategic efforts to prevent bloodshed and violence.
The essence of the entire concept of this conference — including the first two themes conflict avoidance and environmental consciousness — is contained in the dialogue part of it which calls for a shift from the “them vs us” ideological approach to philosophic approach.
It is necessary to inform the world about the need to shift from ideology — whether religious or secular — to philosophy.
When I spoke at the Unite Nations last year, I briefly mentioned that the world needs to shift from ideological approach to philosophic approach.
A day later when I addressed the Council for Foreign Relations, I expanded on this concept a little more.
Thus, Hindu and Buddhist religions are in that sense more philosophies and not just belief systems.
It is my firm belief that the solution to all problems lies in dialogue.
Earlier, it was believed that force indicates power.
Now, power must come through the strength of ideas and the effective dialogue.
We have seen the adverse effects of war.
The first half of the 20th century was witness to the horrors of two world wars.
All of us here have a cardinal duty to ensure that our future generations lead a life of peace, dignity and mutual respect.
Adi Sankara wanted to establish through dialogue and debate with the highest authority on ritualism and that rituals were not necessary for attaining Mukti, while Mandana Mishra wanted to prove that Sankara was wrong in dismissing rituals.
This was how, in ancient India, debates on sensitive issues between scholars avoided such issues being settled in streets.
Anger within is a sign of defeat.
On this logic, Mandana Mishra was declared as having lost the debate!
I see Lord Buddha doing to our collective spiritual well-being what global trade did to our collective economic well-being and the digital internet did to our collective intellectual well-being.
I see Lord Buddha in the 21st Century across national borders, across faith systems, across political ideologies, playing the role of a bridge to promote understanding to counsel patience and to enlighten us with tolerance and empathy.
You are visiting a nation that is extremely proud of its Buddhist heritage.
My hometown of Vadnagar in Gujarat is one of the many sites where Buddhist relics were found and was one of the places visited by Chinese traveller and chronicler, Xuanzang.
The SAARC region is home to the holy sites of Buddhism; Lumbini, Bodh Gaya, Sarnath, Kushinagar.
My Government is doing everything possible to give an impetus to this Buddhist heritage across India, and India is taking the lead in boosting the Buddhist heritage across Asia.
I look forward to seeing you in Bodh Gaya the day after.

President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
Distinguished Delegates from India and abroad
I am happy to be here in Mumbai, for the Third Annual Meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
We are happy to have this opportunity to deepen our engagement with the bank and its members.
AIIB started its financing operations in January 2016.
In less than three years, it has in its fold, 87 members.
And a committed capital stock of 100 billion US Dollars.
It is poised to play a critical role in Asia.
The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a result of collaborative efforts of Asian countries to provide a better tomorrow to our people.
As developing countries, we share similar challenges.
One of them is to find resources for provision of infrastructure.
I am happy that the theme of this year’s Meeting is “Mobilizing Finance for Infrastructure: Innovation and Collaboration”.
Investments by AIIB in sustainable infrastructure can impact the lives of billions of people.
Asia still faces wide ranging disparities in access to education, healthcare, financial services and formal employment opportunities.
Regional multi-lateralism through institutions such as AIIB can play a central role in helping to raise resources.
This is a good beginning.
This would require simpler processing, and faster approval.
It would also need high quality projects and robust project proposals.
I believe that India and AIIB are both strongly committed to making economic growth more inclusive and sustainable.
Hence, for such assets, institutional investment from pension, insurance and sovereign wealth funds are likely to be more forthcoming.
This Fund has received a boost with AIIB committing 200 million US Dollars for investment.
India is one of the most investor-friendly economies in the world.
Investors look for growth and macro-economic stability.
They want political stability and a supportive regulatory framework to ensure protection of their investment.
From the point of larger scale of operations and higher value addition, an investor is also attracted by a large domestic market size, availability of skilled labour and good physical infrastructure.
India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy which is driving global growth as well.
It is the third largest in terms of purchasing power parity.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we grew at 7.7 per cent.
In 2018, we are projected to grow at 7.4 per cent.
Despite rising oil prices, inflation is within the mandated range.
The Government is firmly committed to the path of fiscal consolidation.
Government debt as percentage of GDP is consistently declining.
India has achieved a rating upgrade after a long wait.
The external sector remains robust.
Our foreign exchange reserves of more than 400 billion US dollars provide us enough cushion.
Global confidence in India’s economy is rising.
As per UNCTAD’s World Investment Report, India continues to be one of the top FDI destinations in the world.
From the point of a foreign investor, India counts as an extremely low risk political economy.
The Government has taken a number of steps to boost investment.
We have simplified rules and regulations for businesses and undertaken bold reforms.
We have provided investors an environment which is efficient, transparent, reliable and predictable.
We have liberalized the FDI regime.
Today, most sectors are on automatic approval route.
The Goods and Services Tax is one of the most significant systemic reforms that our country has undergone.
It works on the One Nation – One Tax principle.
It reduces tax cascading, increases transparency, and adds to logistics efficiency.
These and other changes have been noticed by the global fraternity.
India has jumped 42 places in three years to enter the top hundred in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report 2018.
The size and growth of the Indian market hold much potential.
India’s per capita income has doubled in the last ten years.
We have over 300 million middle class consumers.
This number is expected to double in the next ten years.
The size and scale of requirement in India gives the added advantage of economies of scale for investors.
For example, the housing programme in India targets ten million houses in urban areas.
This would be more than the total requirement of a lot of countries taken together.
Therefore the use of new technology in house construction would have added advantage, if tried in India.
Another example of scale would be the Renewable Energy Programme in India.
We have set a target to construct capacity of 175 Giga Watt of renewable energy by the year 2022.
Of this, the solar energy capacity will amount to 100 Giga Watt.
And we are well on course to exceed these targets.
We have added more capacity to renewable energy than conventional energy in 2017.
We are also making collaborative efforts to mainstream solar energy in the form of an International Solar Alliance.
The founding conference of the Alliance was held in New Delhi earlier this year.
The Alliance aims at a solar capacity of 1000 Giga Watt with an investment of one trillion US Dollars by 2030.
India is working on e-mobility.
The challenge before us is of technology, particularly with respect to storage.
We will be hosting a global mobility conference this year.
I hope that this will help us in moving forward.
In India, we are upgrading connectivity at all levels.
The Bharatmala scheme is aimed at improving road connectivity by constructing national corridors and highways.
The Sagarmala project has been undertaken for boosting port connectivity, port modernization and port-linked industries.
Dedicated Freight Corridors are being developed to mitigate the congestion of our railway network.
The Jal Marg Vikas project would augment capacity of navigation on National Waterways for internal trade carried through inland water transport.
Our UDAN scheme works towards regional airport development and improved air connectivity.
While we talk about the conventional concept of infrastructure, I must mention some of the modern day infrastructure on which India has worked.
Bharat Net is targeted at providing last mile internet connectivity in the country.
We are promoting the use of digital payments.
Our United Payments Interface system or UPI along with BHIM App and RuPay Card has shown the true potential of digital economy in India.
Through the UMANG App, more than 100 public services have been made available to the citizens through their mobile phone.
Our Digital India Mission aims to bridge the rural-urban digital divide.
Agriculture is the lifeline of the Indian economy.
We are promoting investments in warehouses and cold chains, food processing, crop insurance and allied activities.
We are promoting micro-irrigation to ensure optimal use of water with increased productivity.
I would like AIIB to look into potential investment opportunities in this field and associate with us.
We aim to provide every poor and homeless household a house with toilet, water and electricity by the year 2022.
We are also looking at various strategies for effective waste management.
We have also recently launched Ayushman Bharat, our National Health Protection Mission.
This will provide a benefit cover of over 7000 dollars annually to more than 100 million poor and vulnerable families.
The resulting expansion of health care facilities will lead to the creation of a large number of jobs.
This will also promote the production of high quality medicines, consumables and other medical technology equipment.
Jobs will also be created for ancillary activities including call centres, research and evaluation and IEC activities.
The entire healthcare industry will receive a boost.
Moreover, with the Government assuring healthcare benefits, the savings of a family, can now be better used for other consumption and investment.
This increased disposable income in the hands of a poor family would lead to increased demand in the economy.
I see great untapped potential in this for investors.
The Indian story of economic resurgence closely mirrors that of many other parts of Asia.
Now, the continent finds itself at the centre of global economic activity.
It has become the main growth engine of the world.
In fact, we are now living through what many have termed the ‘Asian Century’.
A ‘New India’ is rising.
It is an India that stands on the pillars of economic opportunity for all, knowledge economy, holistic development, and futuristic, resilient and digital infrastructure.
We look forward to our continued engagement with our development partners including AIIB.
The act is applicable to all establishments employing 10 or more persons.
The amendments will help 1.8 million (approx.) women workforce in organised sector.

President Hollande, Excellencies, industry leaders,
For his support at every step, and his decision to co-chair the launch, I am deeply grateful.
Just as positive was his response to the idea of a book of quotations on Nature from the world to remind us all of our timeless wisdom.
I am honoured to co-author the preface with him.
Since ancient times, different civilizations have given a special place to Sun.
In the Indian tradition, Sun is the source of all forms of energy.
As Rig Veda says, Sun God is the Soul of all beings, moving and non-moving.
Many in India begin their day with a prayer to the Sun.
Today, when the energy sources and excesses of our industrial age have put our planet in peril, the world must turn to Sun to power our future.
As the developing world lift billions of people into prosperity, our hope for a sustainable planet rests on a bold global initiative.
It will mean advanced countries leaving enough carbon space for developing countries to grow.
That is natural climate justice.
It also means a growth path with lighter carbon footprint.
So, convergence between economy, ecology and energy should define our future.
The vast majority of humanity is blessed with generous sunlight round the year.
Yet, many are also without any source of power.
This is why this alliance is so important.
We will collaborate on research and innovation.
We will share knowledge and exchange best practices.
We will cooperate on training and building institutions.
We will discuss regulatory issues and promote common standards.
We will partner with other international initiatives on renewable energy.
There is already a revolution in solar energy.
Technology is evolving, costs are coming down and grid connectivity is improving.
It is making the dream of universal access to clean energy become more real.
By the end of next year, we would have added another 12 GW.
I am delighted with the industry response.
India will be pleased to host this initiative at the premises of our National Institute of Solar Energy.
The MoU is expected to forge better understanding about each other’s regulatory requirements and would be beneficial to both the countries.
It could also facilitate India’s export of pharmaceutical products.
It will also establish a framework for fruitful cooperation and exchange of information between the two countries in matters relating to Pharmaceutical products regulation on the basis for equality, reciprocity and mutual benefit.

Our efforts should be to prepare CSIR for modern technologies and emerging challenges.

Recently, CSIR has developed the first Ayurvedic medicine of the country for diabetic patients.
All of you are aware about the potential of this medicine.
Now our goal should be to make people aware of the benefits of this medicine so that they can make best use of the same.

My dear countrymen, Saadar Namaskar.
When on the one hand, a sense of festivity pervades the land, and on the other, news of violence comes in, from one part of the country, it is only natural of be concerned.
For centuries, our forefathers have imbibed community values, nonviolence, mutual respect – these are inherent to us.
We have been hearing and saying Ahimsa Parmo Dharmah from our childhood.
In my address from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I had said that violence in the name of faith will not be tolerated, whether it is communal belief systems, whether it is subscribing to political ideologies, whether it is allegiance to a person or customs and traditions.
No one has the right to take the law into one’s own hands in the name of one’s beliefs.
In the Constitution given to us by Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar there is every provision for ensuring justice for each and every person.
I want to assure my countrymen that people who take the law into their own handsand are on the path of violent suppression – whether it is a person or a group –neither this country nor any government will tolerate it.
Each and every person will have to abide by the law; the law will fix accountability and the guilty will unquestionably be punished.
My dear countrymen, our country is a land of diversities – these diversities are not limited to our cuisine, life style and attire.
We observe diversity in every walk of life.
Speaking about festivals today, I would first like to wish you all michhamidukkadam.
The Jain community celebrated the Samvatsari Parva yesterday.
In the month of Bhadra, ParyushanParva is celebrated by the Jain Community.
The festival of Samvatsari is symbolic of forgiveness, non-violence and brotherhood.
It is also known as the KshamavaniParva, and on this day, people traditionally greet each other with, ‘michhamidukkadam.’
We have been hearing in our shaastras, our holy texts, “KshamaVeerasya Bhushanam”, that is, forgiveness is the adornment of the brave.
The one who forgives is valiant.
And Mahatma Gandhi always said, that forgiveness is the quality of great men.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great fervor all across the country.
When we speak of Ganesh Chaturthi, it is but natural to talk about Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav, that is, community celebrations of the Ganesh Festival.
And after Independence, this festival has become a vehicle of raising social and educational awareness.
Ganesh Chaturthi is a ten-day festival.
This Mahaparva, mega-festival stands for unity, equality, integrity and honesty.
My heartiest greetings to all of you on the occasion of Ganeshotsav.
The festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerela.
Of the numerous colourful festivals of India, Onam is a prime festival of Kerela.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
This festival showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
Our festivals are now becoming great attractions for tourism.
And I would like to mention to my countrymen, that festivals like Navaratri in Gujarat, or Durga Utsav in Bengal are tremendous tourist attractions.
Other festivals of our country too, provide an opportunity to attract foreign visitors.
We should think about what more can be done in this direction.
In this series of festivals, Eid-ul-Zuha will be celebrated in a few days from now.
Heartiest felicitations and best wishes to all countrymen on the occasion of Eid-ul-Zuha.
Festivals are of course symbols of faith and belief; in the New India, we should transform them into symbols of cleanliness as well.
In individual households, festivals and cleanliness are linked together.
In fact, preparations for festivals always begin with cleaning.
This is nothing new for us, but it is important to convert it into a social character.
Public cleanliness must be insisted upon not just in our homes but in our villages, towns, cities, states and in our entire country – Cleanliness has to be inextricably linked to our festivals.
My dear countrymen, definitions of being modern are perpetually changing.
Some are using vegetable colours, while some are pasting bits and pieces `of paper.
All sorts of experiments are being carried out in every family.
This is probably the first of its kind, the most widespread experiment in environment consciousness.
Media houses too, are making a great effort in training people, inspiring them and guiding them towards ecofriendly Ganesh idols.
What a massive transformation this has been; a pleasant one at that.
And as I mentioned, our country is blessed with millions and millions of the brightest of brains.
And it is nice to see all sorts of new innovations.
Someone told me about a gentleman who is an engineer and who has collected and combined special varieties of clay, to give training in making Ganesh idols.
The campaign for Cleanliness which was initiated three years ago will be marking its third anniversary on the 2nd of October.
And the positive results are now being seen.
Gujarat saw devastating floods recently.
They came together and toiled collectively.
The volunteers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hindset a fine, inspiring example of unity for cleanliness.
If this committed effort towards cleanliness become inherent to us, our country will certainly take our nation to greater heights.
My dear countrymen, I call upon you to begin a campaign, Swachchata Hi Sewa, Cleanliness is Service, at least fifteen-twenty days prior to Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October – on the lines of the age-old belief, Jal Seva Yahi Prabhu Seva, Service to Water is Service to God.
Let’s create an environment of cleanliness in the entire country.
Whenever and wherever possible, let’s look for the opportunity.
Go to settlements in your neighborhood, go to nearby villages, but do this in the form of a movement.
I urge all NGOs, schools, colleges, social, cultural and political leaders, people in the government, collectors and sarpanches, to begin creating an environment of cleanliness at least fifteen days ahead of Gandhi Jayanti on the 2nd of October so that it turns out to be the 2nd October of Gandhi’s dreams.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has created a section on MyGov.in where after constructing a toilet you can register your name and the name of the beneficiary family, who you helped.
My friends from the social media can run a few creative campaigns and thus become a source of inspiration in the virtual world, to see results in the real world.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has organized, the Swachch Sankalp se Swachcha Siddhi Pratiyogita, From the resolve of Cleanliness to attaining Cleanliness Competition comprising an essay competition, a short film making competition and a painting competition.
The best three participants – three at the district level, three at the state level will be given prizes.
I invite one and all – Come, join the Cleanliness Campaign in this manner as well.
Take one or another step towards cleanliness.
You can imagine the inner bliss of paying homage to our revered Bapu, with fifteen days of this cleanliness campaign, Swachchata Hi Seva, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on the 2nd of October.
My dear countrymen, I want to specially express my indebtedness to you.
I want to thank you from the core of my heart, not because you have been connected with Mann Ki Baat, for such a long time – I want to express my gratitude and indebtedness as millions of people from across the country come together with Mann ki Baat.
The number of listeners are in crores out of which lakhs of people write letters to me, send messages, and get their messages recorded on phone, which is a huge treasure for me.
This has become a great opportunity for me to understand the hearts and minds of one and all.
Much as you wait for Mann ki Baat, I await your messages with greater eagerness.
I always look forward with anticipation, because I find so much to learn from all that you share.
It is an opportunity to test my endeavors on this touchstone.
My endeavor always is to see for myself, hear, read and understand your thoughts.
“Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Aparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about a friend of mine.
She always tries to help others, but one habit of hers amazes me.
I went for shopping with her at a mall.
She coolly spent two thousand rupees on a sari, and four hundred and fifty rupees on a pizza.
Whereas, she haggled for a long time, over merely five rupees, with the auto driver, who took us to the mall.
On the way back, we stopped to buy vegetables, and again she haggled with the vendors to save 4-5 rupees.
I feel very bad.
Now after listening to this phone call, I am certain that you would have been shocked and awakened and would probably have resolved not to repeat such a mistake.
Not just this, when we go to a showroom to buy a saree, we don’t bargain, but when it comes to someone poor, we just cannot resist bargaining.
Have you ever wondered what a poor man goes through?
Two or five rupees make no difference to your life, but have you thought how much heartache this petty habit of yours can cause him.
Madam I am grateful to you for calling me with this touching message.
I am certain that my countrymen, if they are in the habit of behaving in this way with the poor will now stop doing so.
My dear young friends, the country celebrates National Sports Day on the 29th of August.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player, hockey wizard, Major Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to hockey was unparalleled.
I am reminding you of this because I want the younger generation of our country to take part in sports.
Sports should become a part of our lives.
If we are a young nation, our youth should get manifested in the field sports as well.
Sports means, physical fitness, mental alertness and personality enhancement.
What else does one need?
Sports, in a way, is a recipe that brings people together.
The young generation of our country should come forward in the world of sports – and in today’s computer era I would like to alert you to the fact that the playing field is far more important than the play station.
Play FIFA on the computer, but sometimes show your skills with the football out in the field.
You must be playing cricket on the computer but the pleasure of actually playing cricket in an open field under the sky is something else.
There was a time when the children in the family went out to play, the mother would first ask, “When will you come back home?”
The good news for our young friends is that the FIFA Under 17 World Cup is being organized in India, from the 6th to the 28th of October.
Twenty-four teams from all over the world will be making India their home.
Come, let’s welcome the young visitors from all across the world with the festival of Sports, let’s enjoy the sport, and create a conducive sporting atmosphere in the country.
Sometimes they will spend 40 days on the seas in one go; at times, thirty.
Each and every Indian would be proud of these daughters.
I salute their valour and I have asked them to share their experiences with the entire country.
I too am making a separate arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App to ensure that you can read it.
For this is a tale of heroism, a tale of personal experiences, and I would be happy to bring you the stories of these daughters.
My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate 5th September as Teacher’s Day.
It is the birthday of our former President, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President, but all through his life, he saw himself as a teacher.
He preferred to live a teacher’s life.
He was committed to being a teacher.
He was a scholar, a diplomat, the President of India and yet, quintessentially a teacher.
The most important quality of a teacher, is to awaken in his students, a sense of creativity and the joy of learning.
When we speak about transformation in our country, we must think of our teachers as we do of our mothers.
The teacher plays a vital role in transformation.
In the life of every teacher, there are incidents of simple efforts that succeeded in bringing about a transformation in somebody’s life.
Come, let’s move forward with the mantra, Teach to Transform.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, financial inclusion, had been a point of discussion amongst Financial Pundits, not just in India, but all over the world.
On the 28th of August 2014, we had launched this campaign with a dream in our hearts.
Tomorrow on the 28th of August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna will complete three years.
Thirty crore new families have been linked to this scheme, bank accounts have been opened.
This number is larger than the population of many countries of the world.
When there is cash in the hand, or in the pocket or at home, one is tempted to indulge in wasteful expenditure.
The money can be used productively in the days to come.
Schemes like, Pradhan Mantri Jeewan Jyoti Bima Yojna, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna, with a small premium of one rupee or thirty rupees, are giving a new sense of confidence to the poor.
For many families, in times of adversity, or on the demise of the head of the family, through the one-rupee insurance, they received two lakh rupees in a matter of days.
I will try my best to bring these to you; and the media can also take advantage of these inspiring stories.
They too, can interview such people, and inspire the young generation.
My dear countrymen, once again, I wish you “michchamidukkadm.”

Her good work for the people of Tamil Nadu will be remembered for generations.
I am happy that the Tamil Nadu government is working hard to fulfill her development vision.
I am proud that India’s first woman Defence Minister Nirmala Ji is from Tamil Nadu.

The community service efforts of the Kendra are commendable and inspiring.

Today India is the fastest growing large economy in the world.
India is creating next generation infrastructure at a record pace.
We are among the nations with the largest start-up eco-system.
India is also home to the largest healthcare programme in the world- Ayushman Bharat.
Just last Sunday, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi that was announced in this year’s Budget was launched.
Under this scheme, farmers having up to five acres of land would be given a monetary support of six thousand rupees per year from the Central Government in three instalments.
Over 1.1 crore farmers have already got their first instalment directly in their bank accounts.
Can you imagine, a scheme announced on first February has become a reality in the same month itself.
We worked twenty-four hours non-stop to ensure the scheme is rolled out in twenty-four days.
Like leap years and Football world cups come once in four years, incomplete loan waivers of the Congress come just before an election.
After doing nothing for farmers, they will come at the end and say- we will waive off your loans.
In reality, Congress loan waivers benefit few farmers.
NDA government’s Kisan Samman Nidhi is not a once in a few years scheme.
Benefits will be given every year and in ten years, about 7.5 lakh crore rupees would have gone to hard-working farmers.
When a government works with speed and scale, it clearly shows.
The great sage Tiruvalluvar said “When the rare chance comes, seize it to do the rare deed.”
In 2014, it was after thirty years that a Party got a full majority in the Parliament.
The people’s message was clear- they wanted a Government that takes the lead in taking and bold and tough decisions.
People wanted honesty, not dynasty.
People wanted development, not decay.
People wanted progress, not policy paralysis.
People wanted opportunities, not obstacles.
People wanted security, not stagnation
People wanted inclusive growth, not votebank politics.
Guided by ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ and with the active participation of 130 crore Indians, the NDA government has undertaken some of the most historic decisions in national interest.
Let me give you a few local and national examples.
Tamil Nadu is a coastal state, where the fisheries sector is vibrant.
Several of our fishermen brothers and sisters work hard to earn their living.
It is the NDA government that has had the honour of creating a new department for fisheries.
Previous governments came to take your votes but when it came to doing work for fishermen, they had nothing much to show.
The benefits of Kisan Credit Card have also been launched for our fishermen and women.
The Centre has released over Rupees three hundred crores towards construction of Deep Sea Fishing Vessels in Tamil Nadu.
Fishermen in the sea get help from space.
We understand that if we want to increase the income of Fishermen brothers and sisters, then we have to develop infrastructure associated with fisheries.
The construction works of Mukayur Fishing Harbour in Ramanathapuram district and Pumpuhar Fishing Harbour in Nagapattinam are almost completed.
The Government of India is most sensitive to the safety and well-being of fishermen.
NDA government has put renewed focus on our coastal areas, with stress on connectivity and prosperity.
Going a step ahead of port development, we are working on port-led development.
More ports are being created.
The capacity and efficiency of existing ports are being improved.
The Sagarmala project is also a part of our vision.
Work is being carried out on this project keeping in view the needs of not only the present but also future generations.
Let me also talk about defence and security.
With the blessings of our ex-servicemen, we took the historic decision of making One Rank One Pension a reality.
It was the right thing to do.
Those who ruled the nation for so many years never even bothered to think about OROP properly.
India has been facing the menace of terrorism for years.
But, there is a big difference now- India will no longer be helpless in the wake of terror.
From 2004 to 2014 there were several terror attacks.
And today, we are in an era where the news reads- Armed forces have full freedom to do what they want.
This is an India that will return the damage done by terrorists with interest.
The events of the past few days have demonstrated yet again the strength of our armed forces.
It has also brought our nation closer.
Sadly, a few political parties, guided by Modi hatred have started hating India.
No wonder, while the entire nation supports our armed forces, they suspect the armed forces.
These are the same people whose statements are helping Pakistan and harming India.
They are the same people whose statements are being happily quoted in the Parliament of Pakistan and in the radio of Pakistan.
I want to ask them- do you support our armed forces or suspect them?
They should clarify- Do they believe our armed forces or they believe those forces who support terrorism on our soil?
Please stop weakening India to strengthen your own politics.
In matters of defence and national security, we are Indians first and Indians only.
Your politics can wait, it is the safety of our nation that is at stake.
Let us talk about corruption and black money.
India has seen Prime Ministers who said- out of every Rupee, only fifteen paisa reaches the poor.
India has seen arrogant Cabinet Ministers who say, ‘Zero Loss’ to a scam worth lakhs of crores.
Some people say corruption as a way of life.
This would be acceptable to them but not to me.
The NDA government has taken historic steps against corruption.
The corrupt now have to answer for their misdeeds.
While we have come down heavily on corruption, we are at the same time rewarding the honest tax-payers.
During the budget exactly a month ago, it was announced that those earning upto Rupees Five Lakhs would not pay income tax!
Did those who ruled India for such long years think about the middle class or to give them tax relief?
For many years, the Congress promoted an economic culture that benefitted only the friends and family members of big dynasties.
The common man had no incentive or ability to economically prosper.
If there was someone who spoke out against the economic culture of the Congress it was the son of Tamil Nadu, C. Rajagopalachari.
Today we are fulfilling the dreams of Rajaji by creating an economy that is reform oriented and people-friendly.
India’s ranking for ‘Ease of Doing Business’ has come risen by 65 places.
We are now placed 77th while we were placed 142 four years ago.
Central Government announced a series of benefits for the MSME sector last year.
Now, it is possible to get a loan up to Rupees one crore in 59 minutes!
That is faster than the time you will take to reach Chennai.
We are betting on India’s youth and their talent.
That is why, the Mudra Yojana was launched to give wings to the spirit of enterprise of young India.
Under Mudra, 15 crore people have got loans totaling worth over Rupees seven lakh crore.
Tamil Nadu is one of the top states under this scheme.
The Opposition has no commitment to social justice.
The worse atrocities against Dalits have happened under Congress rule.
Congress got Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar defeated not once but twice.
Congress did not give a Bharat Ratna to Dr. Ambedkar for forty years and nor did Congress put Dr. Ambedkar’s portrait in Central Hall of Parliament.
It was a BJP supported non-Congress Government that did both these things.
The current NDA government has made the strongest amendments to the SC ST Act.
Economic and social justice are articles of faith for us, not slogans to win votes.
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections have two distinct sides.
Our side offers strength and stability.
The other side offers weakness and vulnerability.
Our leadership and work culture is known across India.
The other side is a confused.
They have no name to offer as the nation’s next leader.
No aim or vision for India’s growth.
And no shame that prevents them from doing record corruption.
There was telephone bargaining for minister posts.
The Maha Milaawat or adulteration government will remain hostage to individual egos and dynastic ambitions.
My only family is 130 crore Indians.
I will live for them, I will die for them.
I am not in public life to further a dynasty.
I am here to do whatever I can for the growth of India.
I seek your support and blessings to create an India where the dreams of the poorest of the poor are fulfilled.

The Prime Minister spoke of how the Metro in Delhi has positively impacted the lives of citizens.
Noting that Bahadurgarh is witnessing tremendous economic growth, the Prime Minister said that there are several educational centres there, and students from there even travel to Delhi.
The Metro will make this more convenient, he added.
Shri Narendra Modi said that there is a direct link between connectivity and development.
He said the Metro will mean more employment opportunities for the people in the area.
The Prime Minister said that the Union Government has brought out a policy relating to Metros, to bring uniformity and standardization in metro rail networks across the country.
He said the objective is to build convenient, comfortable and affordable urban transport systems in our cities.
The Prime Minister will arrive in Dublin, Ireland where he will hold talks with Mr. Enda Kenny, the Taoiseach of Ireland.

I am pleased to be here today to mark twenty years of Bloomberg’s presence in India.
During that period, Bloomberg has provided intelligent commentary and incisive analysis of India’s economy.
It has become an essential part of the finance landscape.
Apart from that, I am grateful for the valuable advice that we have received from Mr. Michael Bloomberg in the design of our Smart Cities programme.
As Mayor of one of the world’s great cities, Mr. Bloomberg has personal insight into what makes a city tick.
His ideas have enriched the design of our Smart Cities programme.
The world expects much from India, in terms of contributing to global growth.
To the extent that time permits, I would like to place before you my thoughts on how India intends to meet the challenge.
I will touch upon three major areas.
Firstly, I will discuss India’s economic growth.
Secondly, I will outline some of the administrative and policy reforms that have created and will sustain that growth.
Thirdly, I will elaborate on an aspect of economic development which is of particular importance to me, namely job creation.
Experts are unanimous that India is one of the world economy’s brightest spots.
This is the result of good policy, not good fortune.
• Between 2008 and 2009 crude oil prices fell steeply from a peak of 147 dollars per barrel to less than 50 dollars.
This was a steeper fall than between 2014 and 2015.
• Many other emerging economies also depend on imported oil.
If oil prices were the driver of success, those countries would all be showing similar results.
But they are not.
• We have not been lucky with global trade or growth.
Both are low, and have not helped us in terms of export stimulus.
• We have not been lucky with monsoons or weather.
2015 and 2014 have both been drought years.
Drought was compounded by unseasonal hail storms.
Yet food grain production has remained much higher, and inflation much lower, than in the last comparable drought year, which was 2009-10.
For India to be at the top of global growth tables is an unusual situation.
The fact is that India’s economic success is the hard-won result of prudence, sound policy and effective management.
We have met ambitious fiscal targets in each of the previous two fiscal years.
We have reduced the deficit even while increasing capital expenditure.
And the reduction has come despite an unprecedented steep cut in the Centre’s share of tax revenues, in the award of the fourteenth Finance Commission.
For 2016-17, we have targeted a fiscal deficit of 3.5 per cent of GDP.
This will be the second lowest level in the last 40 years.
Our growth rate is acknowledged as the highest among major economies.
There are some who remain confused and have said that the growth rate does not ‘feel’ right.
Perhaps I can be of some assistance to them in reducing the confusion, by stating facts in place of feelings.
Let us first look at credit.
There has been a smart pick-up in credit growth after September 2015.
Credit off-take between February 2015 and February 2016 increased by 11.5 per cent.
The overall fund flow to the corporate sector through equity and borrowings of various kinds, domestic and foreign, has increased in the first three quarters of 2015-16 by over 30 per cent.
There are some very interesting figures on credit ratings.
In 2013 and 2014, the number of firms whose credit rating was downgraded was much higher than those who were upgraded.
That has now changed decisively.
Upgrades are up and downgrades are down.
The Government and Reserve Bank have taken tough action to recover dues from large corporate defaulters.
These are sectors that are closely connected with the rural economy.
I am thrilled to see that foreign investment is flowing into them.
In the year to September 2015, FDI in construction activities showed 316 per cent growth.
Computer software and hardware had 285 per cent growth.
FDI in the automobile industry grew 71 per cent.
This is concrete evidence that the Make in India policy is having effect in employment intensive sectors.
In a difficult global environment for exports, manufacturing output has fluctuated.
However, several key sub-sectors of manufacturing are growing rapidly.
In the past, the emphasis has been on agricultural output, rather than on farmers’ incomes.
I have set the objective of doubling farmers’ income by 2022.
I have laid this out as a challenge, but it is not merely a challenge.
With a good strategy, well-designed programmes, adequate resources and good governance in implementation, this target is achievable.
And, as a large share of our population depends on agriculture, a doubling of farmers’ incomes will have strong benefits for other sectors of the economy.
Let me outline our strategy.
• First, we have introduced a big focus on irrigation with a large increase in budgets.
We are taking a holistic approach which combines irrigation with water conservation.
The aim is ‘per drop, more crop’.
• Second, we are focusing on provision of quality seeds and on efficiency of nutrient use.
The provision of soil health cards enables accurate selection of inputs according to the requirements of each field.
These will lower costs of production and increase net income.
• Third, a large portion of the harvest is lost before it reaches the consumer.
In perishables the loss occurs in transit.
In non-perishables, it happens during storage.
We are reducing post-harvest losses through big investments in warehousing infrastructure and cold chain.
We have greatly increased the outlay for agricultural infrastructure.
• Fourth, we are promoting value addition through food processing.
As an example, in response to a call from me, Coca Cola has recently started adding fruit juice to some of its aerated drinks.
• Fifth, we are creating a national agricultural market and removing distortions.
A common electronic market platform is being introduced across 585 regulated wholesale markets.
We want to ensure that a higher share of the final price goes to the farmer, with less going to middlemen.
The introduction of FDI in marketing of domestic food products in this budget is with the same objective.
• Sixth, we have introduced the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.
This scheme will ensure that their incomes are protected in times of adverse weather.
• Seventh, we will increase income from ancillary activities.
I am confident we will achieve the targeted doubling of farmers’ income.
I am happy to note that Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, the doyen of Indian agriculture, seems to agree.
He wrote to me after the budget expressing gratitude for the farmer-centric budget.
He welcomed the income orientation given to farming.
He went on to say, and I quote,
Seeds have been sown for agricultural transformation and for attracting and retaining youth in farming.
The dawn of a new era in farming is in sight.”
Let me now turn to some of the programmes and policies that underpin our growth.
Let me start with administrative reforms and our focus on execution.
An intelligent strategy is to optimize use of resources through efficiency in implementation.
Mere announcement of policies, or so-called policies, achieves little.
Even more than reformed policies, we need transformed execution.
Let me illustrate.
We are now implementing the Food Security Act nationwide.
We have focused on creating durable assets that benefit the population, rather than the touts.
Our record on implementation in general, and reduction in corruption in particular, is now well understood.
So I will be brief.
Let me now turn to policy reforms.
I have referred to the durable reduction in inflation since this Government took office.
This is partly attributable to bold measures taken to strengthen monetary policy.
Last year, we entered into a Monetary Framework Agreement with the Reserve Bank of India.
This year we have introduced in the Finance Bill, amendments to the Reserve Bank of India Act.
The committee will have no members from the Government.
Another major policy reform is in the petroleum sector.
This will eliminate many layers of bureaucratic controls.
For on-going projects which have not been developed, we have also given marketing and pricing freedom, subject to a transparent ceiling based on published import parity prices.
For renewal of existing Production Sharing Contracts, we have introduced a transparent method involving a flat percentage increase in Government profit share.
Along with the passing of this long pending bill, we have introduced tax incentives for developers and buyers of housing for the neo-middle class and the poor.
The UDAY scheme in the power sector has permanently changed the incentive structure for State Governments.
Ambitious operational targets are backed by credible incentives to perform.
Under this scheme, in a phased manner, State Governments will have to take over losses of distribution companies and count them against their fiscal deficit targets.
This imposes a hard budget constraint on the states.
It creates a powerful incentive for states to manage the electricity sector efficiently.
From an average of less than 1500 Megawatts of solar capacity addition per annum, we are moving up to 10,000 Megawatts per annum.
This will increase the number of navigable waterways from 5 to 106.
These reforms are already bearing fruit.
Two new locomotive factories involving an investment of over 5 billion dollars are being built in Bihar, by GE and Alstom.
In insurance, 9600 crore rupees, approximately 1500 million dollars of FDI, in 12 companies, from leading global insurers has already been approved.
We have enhanced the limits for foreign investment in stock exchanges and allowed them to be listed.
I am sure, you are aware, of the reforms we have undertaken to promote private equity venture capital, and an eco-system for start-ups.
I note that this ‘new economy’ is the focus of your panel discussions.
Finally, let me turn to the major steps we have taken in the area of generating employment.
This is one of my highest priorities.
Labour regulations have also tended to promote informal employment without social protection, rather than formal employment.
We have taken two important steps to change this.
Secondly, the Government has taken the responsibility for paying pension contributions for three years for all new persons enrolling in the Employee Provident Fund.
This will apply to those with wages up to 15,000 rupees per month.
We expect lakhs of the unemployed, and the informally employed, to benefit from these steps.
In a reform to eliminate corruption in government recruitments, we have abolished interviews for lower and middle level positions.
They will now be filled on the basis of transparent examination results.
The Government and Public Sector Undertakings conduct a number of recruitment examinations.
So far, the scores in these examinations have been retained by the Government.
Hereafter, we will make available the results and the candidate information openly to all employers, wherever consent is given by the candidate.
You may be aware of the spectacular progress of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Over 31 million loans have been sanctioned to entrepreneurs for a total value of nearly 19 billion dollars this year.
You will be pleased to know that 77 per cent of these entrepreneurs are women and 22 per cent of them are from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Stand-Up India scheme will also provide 250,000 entrepreneurship loans to women and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
My government’s measures on skill development are well known.
In the Budget, we also announced two path-breaking reforms in the education sector, which I want to elaborate upon.
Our aim is to empower higher educational institutions to help them attain the highest standards.
To start with, we will provide an enabling regulatory architecture to ten public and ten private institutions, so that they emerge as world-class teaching and research institutions.
Their regulatory framework will be separate from existing structures like the University Grants Commission and All India Council for Technical Education.
They will have complete autonomy on academic, administrative and financial matters.
We will provide additional resources for the next five years for the ten public universities.
Eventually, through regulatory reform, we aspire to world-class standards in all colleges and universities.
Another initiative is in school education.
We have now decided that the quality of learning outcomes will be the Government’s primary objective.
Accordingly, we will allocate an increasing share of resources under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan to quality.
These funds will be used to promote local initiatives and innovations to improve learning outcomes.
I am sure, all of you who are parents and all of you who are employers, will welcome these steps in higher and school education respectively.
In conclusion, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have initiated many steps.
Many more lie ahead.
Some have begun bearing fruit.
What we have achieved so far, gives me the confidence that, with the support of the people, we can transform India.
I know it will be difficult.
But I am sure it is do-able.
And I am confident, it will be done.

I am privileged to have been given this opportunity.
The central message of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya’s life was inclusive society, religion and philosophy.
Saint Shri Ramanujacharya believed that whatever is, and whatever will be, is but an expression of God.
He saw the manifestation of God in Human beings, and Human beings in God.
He saw all devotees of God as equal.
When caste distinction and hierarchy had been recognized as integral to society and religion and every one had accepted her place as high and low in the hierarchy, Saint Shri Ramanujacharya rebelled against it – In his personal life and religious teachings.
You all are aware that Saint Shri Ramanujacharya had also linked fulfilling the needs of the poor with social responsibility.
For instance, he got an artificial lake made, spread over 200 acres in Thondanur near Melkot.
This lake continues to exist as a living example of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya’s work for the welfare of the people.

It is a matter of great pleasure for us that President Ramaphosa, an integral friend of India, is present among us today.
India is not new to him, but it is his first visit to India as the President.
And his visit to India is happening during a special moment in our relations.
This is the 150th birth anniversary year of Mahatma Gandhiji.
Last year was the birth centenary year of Nelson Mandela.
And last year was also the silver jubilee year of our diplomatic relations.
I am very happy that President Ramaphosa has come to India on this special occasion.
India is grateful for all this respect and pride they are giving us.
Whole India is grateful to him for allowing us this distinction.
I first met President Ramaphosa when I went to South Africa in 2016.
At that time, he was the Vice-President.
And in our first meeting itself I had experienced his enthusiasm and affection towards India.
I experienced his excellent hospitality during the BRICS Summit in South Africa last year.
I warmly welcome the President, and his delegation, in India.
During our interactions today with the President, we reviewed all the dimensions of our relations.
Our trade and investment relations are becoming more and more intense.
Our bilateral trade is more than $10 billion.
South Africa participated as the Partner Country in the “Vibrant Gujarat” summit held this year.
And Indian companies are taking active part in the efforts of President Ramaphosa to increase investment in South Africa.
We are also partners in South Africa’s skill development efforts.
The Gandhi-Mandela Skills Institute is set to be established soon in Pretoria.
And we both are committed to take these relationships to a new level.
And therefore, we will meet major business leaders of both the countries in a short while from now.
If we look at the map of the world, it is clear that both India and South Africa are located at very important places in the Indian Ocean.
We both are democratic countries filled with diversities.
We are the successors to the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
And therefore, the broad global outlook of both the countries is quite similar to each other.
Our mutual cooperation and coordination on many forums like BRICS, G-20, Indian Ocean Rim Association, IBSA, is very strong.
We are also working together on the reforms of the UN Security Council.
A special part of the program of this visit of the President to India will be the first “Gandhi-Mandela Freedom Lecture” which is being organized today.
Not only me, whole India and whole South Africa is eager to listen to the thoughts of the Hon’ble President.
Presence of President Ramaphosa on the Republic Day and participation as the Chief Guest, is a symbol of our shared commitment to strengthen our relations.
Today we know that it depends as much on the quality of institutions and ideas.
Early last year, a new institution was created, namely, the National Institution for Transforming India or NITI.
NITI was created as an evidence based think tank to guide India’s transformation.
One of NITI’s functions is:
– to be the Government’s link to the outside world, outside experts and practitioners;
– to be the instrument through which ideas from outside are incorporated into policy-making.
The Government of India and the State Governments have a long administrative tradition.
This tradition combines indigenous and external ideas from India’s past.
This administrative tradition has served India well in many ways.
Above all, it has preserved democracy and federalism, unity and integrity, in a country of glorious diversity.
These are not small achievements.
Yet, we now live in an age where change is constant and we are variables.
We must change for both external and internal reasons.
Each country has its own experiences, its own resources and its own strengths.
Thirty years ago, a country might have been able to look inward and find its own solutions.
Today, countries are inter dependent and inter connected.
No country can afford any longer to develop in isolation.
Every country has to benchmark its activities to global standards, or else fall behind.
Change is also necessary for internal reasons.
The younger generation in our own country is thinking and aspiring so differently, that government can no longer afford to remain rooted in the past.
Even in families, the relationship between the young and old has changed.
This increases the challenge for government in communicating and in meeting rising expectations.
If India is to meet the challenge of change, mere incremental progress is not enough.
A metamorphosis is needed.
That is why my vision for India is rapid transformation, not gradual evolution.
• The transformation of India cannot happen without a transformation of governance.
• A transformation of governance cannot happen without a transformation in mindset.
• A transformation in mindset cannot happen without transformative ideas.
We cannot march through the twenty first century with the administrative systems of the nineteenth century.
Fundamental changes in administrative mindsets usually occur through sudden shocks or crisis.
India is fortunate to be a stable democratic polity.
In the absence of such shocks, we have to make special efforts to force ourselves to make transformative changes.
As individuals, we may absorb new ideas by reading books or articles.
Books open the windows of our minds.
However, unless we brainstorm collectively, ideas remain confined to individual minds.
We often hear of new ideas and understand them.
To do this, we have to absorb new ideas collectively rather than individually.
It requires a concerted effort.
The ideas coming from those sessions are being incorporated into policy.
This is the purpose of the Transforming India Lecture Series.
It is a series which we will attend, not as individuals but as part of a team who can collectively make change happen.
We will draw the best from the wisdom and knowledge of eminent persons, who changed, or influenced change in the lives of many, to make their nation a better place in the planet.
This lecture will be the first in a series.
You have all been given a feedback form.
I look forward to your detailed and frank feedback to help us improve this process.
I request you to suggest names of experts and panelists from inside and outside India.
I also request all Secretaries to Government to conduct a follow up discussion in a week’s time, with the participants from their Ministries.
The purpose is to convert ideas that emerge in today’s session into specific action points relevant to each group.
Wherever possible, I request the Ministers also to participate in these sessions.
It is therefore fitting that we are inaugurating this series with Shri Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore.
He is a prolific scholar and public policy maker.
Apart from being Deputy Prime Minister, he is also the Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies, Minister of Finance and Chairman of Monetary Authority of Singapore.
In the past, he has served as the Minister of Manpower, Second Minister of Finance and Minister of Education.
He earned his Bachelor’s degree in Economics at the London School of Economics.
He has a Master’s degree in Economics from Cambridge University.
He has another Master’s degree in Public Administration from Harvard University.
At Harvard, he was honoured with the Littauer Fellow award for his outstanding performance.
Shri Shanmugaratnam is one of the world’s leading intellectuals.
I would like to give you an example of the range and sweep of his ideas.
Today, Singapore’s economy depends a lot on transshipment.
But if global warming melts the polar ice caps, new navigation routes may open and possibly reduce Singapore’s relevance.
The list of achievements and honours received by Shri Shanmugaratnam is long.
But we are all eager to listen to him.
“Today, on Labour Day we salute the determination and hard work of countless workers who play a big role in India’s progress.
Cabinet approves introduction of the “Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016”
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for introduction of the “Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016”.
No permanent structure is proposed to be created in the Draft Bill.
Neither there are proposals for creating new posts.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended a Sahkar Sammelan in New Delhi, on the occasion of the birth centenary celebrations of Shri Laxmanrao Inamdar.
Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that our country is a “Bahuratna Vasundhara” where many people have made great contributions across regions and time periods.
The Prime Minister said that Vakil Saheb – Laxmanrao Inamdar – was one such person.
He said that Shri Inamdar had imbibed this principle, and his life is a source of inspiration.
He said the cooperative movement can play a key role in the achievement of these objectives.
The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of preserving the “spirit” in the cooperative movement, which he said is still largely intact in the rural areas.
He reiterated Shri Inamdar’s mantra of “Bina Sanskar, Nahin Sahkar.”
The Prime Minister said that today, the farmer buys in retail, but sells in wholesale.
He said the process needs to be reversed, to eliminate middlemen and help raise incomes.
Giving the example of dairy cooperatives, he said that the cooperative movement has the capacity to solve people’s problems.
He added that the cooperative movement is in sync with the nature of Indian society.
The Prime Minister mentioned neem coating of urea, bee keeping, and sea-weed cultivation, as areas where the cooperative movement could contribute significantly.
My Cabinet colleague Shri Ram Vilas Paswan Ji, Shri C.R. Chaudhary Ji, Secretary General, UNCTAD, Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi, and other dignitaries present here.
First of all, I congratulate all of you for this Regional Conference on an important subject like Consumer Protection.
This programme is being attended by representatives from South Asia, Southeast Asia and all the East Asian countries.
I welcome all of you to this programme.
This event is the first of its kind in South Asia.
I would also like to express gratitude to UNCTAD for having supported India’s initiative and playing an active role in bringing it to this stage.
The Coastal Economy has made significant contribution in connecting this region for centuries.
Movement of people from one place to another and exchange of thoughts and ideas, has been a two way process and has benefitted every country in this region.
Today, we all symbolise a shared heritage not only economically but also culturally.
In such a scenario, Consumer Protection is an important component which enhances and strengthens trade in this region.
Today’s event is a reflection of how seriously we understand the needs of our citizens, how hard we strive to overcome their difficulties.
Every citizen is a consumer too and hence this event symbolizes our collective determination.
It is also very heartening to see that the United Nations has come forward as a partner in this entire process.
For the first time in 1985, the UN Guidelines on Consumer Protection were framed.
They were revised two years ago.
India has also played an active role in the process of revision.
These guidelines are very important with regard to Sustainable Consumption, E-Commerce and Financial Services in developing countries.
Friends, consumer protection has been an integral part of governance for ages in India.
Consumers’ protection finds mention in our Vedas written thousands of years ago.
You will be astonished to know that in India around 2500 years ago, during the period of Kautilya, there were guidelines for the government regarding how the trade should be regulated and the interest of the consumers be protected.
The Posts in the organisational structure in the Kautilya period may be considered as Director of Trade and the Superintendent of Standards in today’s context.
Friends, we consider consumer as gods.
Regardless of the nature of business, Consumer satisfaction should be the prime motive.
Friends, today we are in process of enacting a new Consumer Protection Act keeping in view the business practices and requirements of the country.
The proposed Act lays great emphasis on consumer empowerment.
Rules are being simplified to ensure that Consumer grievances are redressed in a time-bound manner and at least possible cost.
Stringent provisions are proposed against misleading advertisements.
A Central Consumer Protection Authority with executive powers will be constituted for quick remedial action.
We have enacted the Real Estate Regulatory Act for the protection of home buyers.
There used to be ambiguity regarding the area of the flat.
Now government has made a stringent provision that 70 per cent of the payment received from buyers will be kept in an “Escrow” account and this amount will be spent on that project only.
Similarly, the Bureau of Indian Standard Act has also been enacted.
Now any commodity or service related to public or consumer interest can be brought under compulsory certification.
Recently, India has also implemented Goods and Services Tax-GST.
After GST, dozens of different types of indirect taxes in the country have been abolished.
Many Hidden Taxes have also gone away.
Now, the consumer knows how much tax he has paid to the state government and how much to the central government.
It is a transparent system in which no one can hurt the interests of the Consumers.
Increased competition due to the GST will lead to moderation in prices.
It will directly benefit poor and middle class consumers.
Friends, besides strengthening the interests of the consumers through the law, it is also necessary that the grievances of the people are promptly addressed.
In the last three years, our government has created a new eco-system for Grievance Redressal by making efficient use of technology.
The capacity of the National Consumer Helpline has been increased 4 times.
Portals and Social Media associated with Consumer Protection have also been integrated.
A large number of private companies have been connected to the portal.
About 40 percent complaints get transferred directly to the companies automatically through the portal enabling quick action.
Consumers are also being made aware through the “Jago Grahak Jago” campaign.
I can confidently state that this govt. has used social media positively for Consumer Protection in India, as has never been done before.
Friends, in my view and in the vision of my govt. the scope of Consumer Protection is very broad.
Development of any country and consumer protection are complementary.
Good governance has an important role in taking the benefits of development to every citizen.
Ensuring delivery of rights and services to the deprived by the Government is also a way of protecting interests of the consumers.
Ujjwala Yojna for Clean Energy, Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan for health and hygiene, Jan-Dhan Yojna for Financial Inclusion reflect this spirit.
The govt. is also working towards the goal that every citizen of the country owns a house by 2022.
Recently, a scheme has also been launched to provide electricity connection to every household of the country.
In India we are also working to formulate schemes which help consumers save money.
The poor and middle class in the country is benefitted most from these schemes.
You might also be aware that UNICEF has recently announced findings of a survey in India.
According to the survey, considering medical costs averted, value of time savings and mortality averted, financial savings for each household in Open Defecation Free communities are Rs. 50,000 per year.
Friends, Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojna has been launched to provide affordable medicines to the poor.
More than 500 medicines have been included in the list of essential drugs and their prices have been reduced.
This also is saving crores of rupees for the poor and middle class people.
Our thinking is to move beyond Consumer Protection to promotion of Consumers Interest.
Friends, keeping the inflation under control has caused economic benefits to the poor and middle class consumers.
Otherwise, the rate at which the Inflation was rising during previous government’s tenure it would have resulted in huge rise in the budget of the common citizen’s kitchen.
By strengthening the Public Distribution System through technology, it is also being ensured that the poor, who have the right to affordable food grains, get their due.
Here, on this occasion, I specially want to inform colleagues from other countries about Give-it-up campaign.
Subsidy is provided on LPG cylinders in our country.
Friends, Government is implementing Prime Minister Rural Digital Literacy Campaign for Digital Empowerment of Consumers living in rural areas of the country.
Digital awareness in the villages of India is also creating a huge e-commerce market for the future.
Unified Payment Interface-UPI has given the e-commerce industry a lot of strength.
Bharat Interface For Money – i.e. BHIM App has expanded digital payments in cities as well as in rural areas.
Through Make in India we are offering a platform to Global Companies to produce in India and to make better use of our huge human resource.
Friends, this is a first of its kind conference in this part of the world.
E-commerce and trans-border mobility of people is resulting in increased cross border transactions.
A framework for cooperation is also necessary to expeditiously act in cases related to consumers from other countries.
This will enhance mutual trust and trade.
Creating a Structured Mechanism for Communication, Mutual Sharing of Best Practices, Creating New Initiatives for Capacity Building and Starting Joint Campaigns, are such areas which can be pursued in mutual interest.
Friends, strengthening of our emotional bonds will also strengthen our shared cultural and trade heritage.
Taking pride in our culture while respecting other cultures is part of our tradition.

Chancellor Merkel,
Members of German delegation,
My colleagues,
It is a great pleasure to welcome Chancellor Angela Merkel and her eminent delegation to India.
On behalf of the people of India, I warmly congratulate Germany on the 25th anniversary of German reunification.
At this important milestone, you can look back with pride on what you have accomplished at home and abroad.
Chancellor Merkel, your leadership is a source of confidence and reassurance at a difficult moment for Europe and the world.
You have chosen to visit India despite many preoccupations in your region.
The strength of your delegation reflects the importance you attach to relations with India and the seriousness with which you approach the Inter Governmental Consultations.
Your commitment holds the key to progress in our relations.
So, thank you very much!
The mechanism of Inter-Governmental Consultation is certainly unique.
And, it has brought about all round growth in our relations.
In addition, in the course of the past year, our two sides have deepened our engagement.
We see Germany as a natural partner in achieving our vision of India’s economic transformation.
German strengths and India’s priorities are aligned.
And, so is our mutual goodwill.
Our focus tends to be on economic ties.
We have a rich history of engagement.
Today, we have met for around three hours.
We will continue our dialogue here and in Bengaluru tomorrow.
I was very pleased with our discussions and the broad range of outcomes.
German response to our development agenda is very encouraging.
We can look forward with confidence to increased investment, trade and technology partnerships in manufacturing, infrastructure and skill development.
German engineering and Indian IT skills can create the next generation industry that will be more efficient, economical and environment friendly.
German cooperation and assistance in areas like smart cities, Clean Ganga and waste management have taken a concrete shape.
So, has our cooperation in education, from engineering to humanities.
I admire German leadership in clean energy and commitment to combating climate change.
We also intend to deepen research cooperation in clean and renewable energy, and energy efficiency.
Our partnership will also grow in areas like defence manufacturing, trade in advanced technology, intelligence, and countering terrorismand radicalism.
These are important security dimensions of our expanding relationship.
I welcome Germany’s strong support for India’s membership of the international export control regimes.
As we discussed in the G4 Summit in New York, Chancellor and I are committed to pursue reforms of the United Nations, especially the Security Council.
I especially thanked her for Germany’s invaluable support for peace, security and development in Afghanistan.
Finally, a very special word of gratitude to Chancellor Merkel and the people of Germany for the return of the 10th century statue of Durga in her Mahishasurmardini avatar from Jammu and Kashmir.
She is a symbol of the victory of good over evil.
This also suggests that in this age of transitions and turmoil, India-Germany partnership will be a force of good for the world.
It is a saying common to both our cultures that friendship is a plant that needs to be watered.
I am confident that after this extraordinary session, the tree of our friendship will blossom.
Namaskar, distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am happy to be present here for the inaugural function of the Vision Conclave as a part of the Global Ayurveda Festival organized in God’s own country – Kerala.
I have been informed that the five-day Global Ayurveda Festival has turned out to be excellent in terms of participation and projection of the various facets of Ayurveda.
It is heartening to note that foreign delegates in large numbers have come from various countries to participate in the Ayurveda festival.
I am sure their participation in this festival will provide a lot of impetus to the spread of Ayurveda.
Ayurveda is generally defined as ‘Science of life’ by translating ‘Ayuh(r)’ as life and ‘Veda’ as science.
Sushruta defines health as:
This means that health is balanced when all three doshas or bioenergy and agni or metabolic process are balanced, and excretions are in proper order.
The Ayurvedic ‘dincharya’ or daily schedule helps to bring about peace and harmony in one’s life.
Ayurvedic daily life routines are meant to enhance the total health of a human being, both mental and physical.
What are the great health challenges that the world is facing today?
Non-communicable diseases, lifestyle related diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and cancers have become the greatest health challenges.
It is in managing these that Ayurveda offers solutions.
These systems try to create balance and preserve health through eco-friendly practices and sustainable sourcing of medicinal herbs.
Unfortunately, the real potential of Ayurveda is untapped because of many reasons.
Most importantly because of inadequate scientific scrutiny and concerns regarding standards and quality.
If these issues are addressed properly, I am sure Ayurveda can provide solutions to many health problems.
India can be a leader in making affordable, holistic health care available to the world.
What can we do, and what are we doing to address these issues?
Our government is fully committed to promotion of Ayurveda and traditional systems of medicine.
As soon as this government was formed, the Department of AYUSH was upgraded to the status of a full Ministry in the Government of India.
The National AYUSH Mission has been started to promote AYUSH medical systems through cost effective AYUSH services, strengthening of educational systems, facilitating the enforcement of quality control of Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani & Homoeopathy drugs and sustainable availability of raw-materials.
For quality control of AYUSH drugs, steps are being taken to bring regulatory amendments for effective enforcement and strengthening the regulatory framework at the Central and State levels.
Creating a vertical structure for AYUSH drugs in Central Drug Standards Control Organization, control over misleading advertisements and extension of financial support to the States under National AYUSH Mission for quality control activities are important initiatives that are underway.
To ensure credibility of knowledge and skills of yoga experts, a Scheme for Voluntary Certification of Yoga Professionals has been launched on 22nd June last year during the “International Conference on Yoga for Holistic Health”.
The WHO strategy contains methodologies for harnessing the potential contribution of Traditional and Complementary Medicine to health, wellness and person-centered healthcare.
Modern systems of medicine have strong and effective diagnostic tools that allow us to screen and detect disease early.
The use of technology in healthcare has the potential to reduce barriers to accessing care, and improve our understanding of disease patterns.
However, we do need to look beyond.
The escalating costs of treatment, the side effects of medicines have prompted medical experts to think of widening their horizons to traditional systems of medicine.
Our efforts are to tap the real potential of Ayurveda and other AYUSH systems in imparting preventive, promotive and holistic healthcare to the people.
We will maximize the utilization of Ayurveda and Yoga and other traditions of healing in accordance with their genius and acumen and help promotion of integrative medical facilities.
Young entrepreneurs who are planning a start-up could find a lot of opportunities in holistic healthcare.
Traditional medicine is affordable to many of the rural people.
It is locally available to the communities, time-tested for its safety and efficacy.
Above all, it imbibes the culture and eco-system of the communities within which it grows.
In many parts of developing countries, traditional medical practices are the only resources of healthcare within the physical and financial reach of the poor people.
It is therefore even more important that we ensure the quality of these systems.
All stakeholders of Ayurveda gathered here must agree that it is important for us to address the issues of safety, efficacy, quality, access and rational use of our traditional medical knowledge of Ayurveda.
We should also move closely with the emerging trends in the areas of bio-medicine, health technology and information technology.
I hope, proper implementation of articles of the Delhi Declaration will help to achieve systematic development of traditional medicine including Ayurveda as well at national, regional and global level.
We would like to offer our institutions as referral centres for training, capacity building and information & technology exchange programs in Ayurveda and other AYUSH systems.
Our leadership on these fronts can be sustained only with concerted efforts for rendering quality healthcare and education and by producing competent professionals.
Ladies and Gentlemen, as you are well aware, India has a long history and rich heritage of Ayurveda and Yoga.
The multi-cultural origins of Ayurvedic knowledge are revealed in the classical texts themselves.
Both Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita urge physicians to seek the help of cowherds, hunters and forest-dwellers for procuring medicinal plants.
In the Charaka Samhita, we notice the participation and contribution of a Central Asian physician in one of the assemblies of scholars gathered to formulate the principles of Ayurveda.
The three major classical texts give importance to Buddhist moral values.
Vagbhata, who is said to be the author of one of the classical texts Ashtangahridayam, was a Buddhist.
We will continue this effort.
The Global Ayurveda Festival takes this vision forward.
I wish the Vision Conclave as well as Global Ayurveda Festival a grand success.
I trust that the deliberations will focus on the crucial issues important for the global positioning of Ayurveda.
I will end with words from Ashtangahridayam, one of the most famous texts of Ayurveda.
The poor, those suffering from disease and those afflicted by sorrow should be helped.
The Force has distinguished itself through its bravery and humanitarian ethos.
India is today described as a bright spot in the global economy.
It has emerged as one of the most attractive global investment destinations.
This has been made possible by a series of sustained policy initiatives.
More than seven thousand reforms have been implemented to improve the ease of doing business.
Processes have been simplified and made transparent.
Government has repealed over twelve hundred outdated laws.
These are just a few examples.
Consequently, India has moved up by thirty two places in the last two years in the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum.
This is the highest for any country.
India moved up nineteen places on the World Bank Logistics Performance Index of 2016.
We have one of the most liberal investment policies for foreign investment in the textile and apparel sector.
We allow 100 percent FDI through automatic route in textile and apparel sector.
The textiles industry has a pivotal position in the Indian economy.
It is strong and competitive across the value chain.
India has an abundant supply of raw material, like cotton, wool, silk, jute, and man-made fibre.
In fact, it is the world’s largest producer of cotton and jute, and second largest producer of silk and man-made fibre.
This provides us the distinct advantage of backward integration, which many other countries may not have.
In addition, India has strong spinning, weaving, knitting and apparel manufacturing capacities.
Young, skilled labour is available at a reasonable cost.
This growth will be driven by the rising middle class.
There is also a high global demand for textiles and apparel manufactured in our country.
An integrated skill development scheme is also being implemented to address the critical gap of skilled manpower, through industry-oriented training programs.
Our strengths in manufacturing and export are backed up by our ability to develop world-class training and research institutes.
The National Institute of Fashion Technology has a network of sixteen professionally managed campuses.
It has been playing a crucial role in benchmarking performance and processes in the areas of fashion education, research and development, training and consultancy.
In the last few years we have witnessed a very healthy competition amongst States to attract investment and industries in their respective States.
As a result, there have been some major reforms that have taken place in States.
Each State in its own way has tried to facilitate the establishment of new industries including textiles.
I think, the time has now come for us to concentrate on textile exports in a big way.
India is a country with diverse culture, fashion and traditions.
This diversity is clearly reflected in the clothing present in different regions.
Each State should appoint nodal officers dedicated to a few well-known products, who would facilitate producers and traders across the value chain.
The intervention should start from production to export of garments.
Government Councils and Industry Bodies should rise to the occasion, in a spirit of cooperation.
This would enable us to channelize our energies in meeting those requirements and give a boost to our exports.
Innovation and research are new mantras for growth and wealth generation.
The textile industry will have to constantly innovate and research for growth and to tap new markets.
For example, physiques may be larger in some parts of the world.
This may require clothing of greater width than the normal size used in our country.
For this, you may need to increase the width of the loom.
Elsewhere, requirements may be different.
Such attention to detail is necessary to attain leadership in export markets.
Today, there is a demand for products with zero carbon footprint.
Holistic lifestyle has become a buzzword.
The market for Organic Dyes, clothes and fabrics made of organic products is growing.
Our effort should be to innovate in organic products.
Apart from cotton and jute, we already have fabrics made of banana and bamboo fibres.
There is a niche market for such products.
Thus, there is a need for further research by our institutions like National Institute of Fashion Technology and Scientific and Industrial Research institutes to develop fabrics from other sources.
Our integrated textile clusters are compliant to global standards of environment and health safety.
I understand that over the next two days, you would have an opportunity to interact with a few State Governments.
Some of my Cabinet colleagues will also interact with you.
I am sure you will find these sessions interesting and informative.
I hope this event will help familiarize global and Indian leaders with India’s enabling policy environment, strengths and vast opportunities associated with the sector.
This will help establish India as a valued partner for countries seeking sourcing and investment opportunities in India.
I hope, it will go a long way in realizing India’s inherent potential to become one of the most significant textile and apparel sourcing and investment destinations.
Let me conclude by wishing you a very successful and productive three days in Gandhinagar.
I call upon you to Come, Invest and Make Textiles in India.
The Prime Minister noted that India is the only major economy across the world, which is moving ahead strongly despite the global economic crisis.
The Prime Minister stressed on the importance of cooperative federalism, which he said must be implemented in letter and spirit.
He said the Centre and States must work together as “Team India.”
The total length of these 3 corridors is 61.679 km.
Out of the total 61.679 km, 22.359 km will be built underground and 39.320 km will be constructed as elevated section.
The total completion cost of three metro corridors will be Rs.24,948.65 crore.
The project will be implemented by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.
On completion of these corridors, the Metro commuters will have more interchange stations which will connect the new corridors with the existing lines of Delhi Metro.
The improved connectivity will offer commuters more options of travel by optimization of routes.
The addition of 61.679 km network through these 3 new corridors will also reduce congestion on the roads and will thus help in reducing pollution caused by motor vehicles.
The Tughlakabad – Aerocity corridor will further improve connectivity to the Airport.
A teacher asked the Prime Minister about what teachers should tell parents who are stressed about the exams of their children, and have unrealistic expectations.
He said that each new day, he resumes his work with a new energy.
Students asked the Prime Minister how studies could be made more fun, and how exams could improve one’s personality.
A student recalled last year’s town hall interaction on the same subject, and said that her parents have become a lot more relaxed when it comes to subjects like exams and career.He said that positive attitude of the parents can contribute in a big way to the lives of children.
He said that when one competes with one’s own past record, then pessimism and negativity can easily be defeated.
Students also mentioned the need to further improve education systems and ensure that exams are not only reduced to rote learning but also showcase what students have learnt.

The event you have organised makes the anniversary of the Chicago address even more special.
Congrats to everybody associated with the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, the Government of Tamil Nadu, thousands of my young friends assembled here today for being part of the commemoration of the historic address.
This combination of the unique satvik qualities of Saints, and the energy and enthusiasm of the young people assembled here is a symbol of the real strength of India.
I may be far away from you but I can still feel this unique energy.
Friends, through his address Swami Vivekanandshone the light of Indian culture, philosophy and ancient traditions for the entire world.
Many people have written about the address in Chicago.
You have, during your deliberations today, also talked about the key points of his address.
The foreign rulers, their judges, their preachers,lost no opportunity to look down upon our thousand years of knowledge and cultural heritage.
Swami Vivekanandji, not only left his mark on the world, but also gave new energy and a new confidence to the freedom movement of the country.
Recently, in the Asian games, our players have shown that no matter how poor you are, no matter what kind of a family you come from, with confidence and hard work, you can make your country proud of you.
Besides, our government has opened the doors of the banks for youth who want to achieve their dreams on their own.
Under the Mudra scheme more than 13 crore loans have been given so far.
This scheme is playing a significant role in enhancing self-employment in the villages and towns of the country.
Our approach is not only to eradicate poverty but also to root out the causes of poverty in the country.
I must remind you that this day is also the anniversary of a very different kind of event – the terrorist attacks of 9/11 that echoed through the world.
Swami ji said “I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance.”
We have a tradition of ‘discuss’ and ‘decide.’
Democracy and Debate are our eternal values.
We have to remember that, despite all the resources at our disposal, whenever Indian society has been divided, whenever there have been internal conflicts, external enemies have taken advantage.
And during these periods of struggle, our saints, social reformers have shown us the right path – the path that brings us back together.
We have to build a new India with the inspiration of Swami Vivekanand.
Congrats to all those thousands of friends in schools and colleges who read and understood the messages of Swamiji, took part in competitions and won prizes.
Thanks again to all of you.”

Your Excellency President Ghani,
Your Excellency, Chief Executive Dr. Abdulla,
Our ties are as ancient as history.
We are just as proud that Afghans see India as a natural destination for education, health or a family home.
Indians remember the support of Afghans for our freedom struggle; the contribution of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, revered as Frontier Gandhi; and, the important footnote of that history, when, exactly hundred years ago, the first Indian Government-in-Exile was formed in Kabul by Maharaja Mahendra Pratap and Maulana Barkatullah.
And, when you began a new journey in a new century, we were proud to stand with you and walk with you.
Our partnership has helped rural communities get schools, minor irrigation, health centres, welfare for children and opportunities for women.
Together, we have built roads that have brought regions closer;
power transmission lines and power stations that light up Afghan homes;
satellite links that bring education, medical advice and communication to Afghan people.
And, we are helping the security forces become more mobile.
The institutions we are establishing together are helping rebuild agriculture and mining in Afghanistan, and make advanced medical care available in Kabul.
Nothing is more important for a nation than its human resources.
So, we are pleased that our scholarships and training programmes are empowering Afghan youth with modern education and professional skills; Afghan government with resources to develop their country; and, the Afghan Security Forces with the capacity to secure their nation.
Power and water will flow out of Salma Dam soon.
The Stor Palace will again stand as a symbol of your priceless heritage.
Our scheme of 1000 scholarships every year for Afghan students in India will continue.
We are pleased with the response to our special scholarship scheme in agriculture science.
Today, I announce 500 scholarships for the children of the martyrs of Afghan security forces.
As we have stood with you in our efforts to rebuild your country, you have guarded and protected our people as your own.
We have faced daily threats, but we feel secure in your midst.
To every Afghan, who has risked or lost his life so that his Indian guest is safe, I convey the eternal gratefulness of India.
To Indian diplomats, officers, engineers and doctors, who serve here with pride, to the families of our Indian martyrs, I express the gratitude of Indians and Afghans.
There are some who did not want us to be here.
Some even tried to discourage us.
But, we are here because you have faith in us.
You never doubted the sincerity of our commitment and the strength of our friendship.
And, you have seen the fruits of our partnership.
You have judged us by what you see, not what others tell you, including about the mysterious Indian consulates.
You know that India is here to contribute not to compete; to lay the foundations of future, not light the flame of conflict; to rebuild lives, not destroy a nation.
You know, as we do, that Indians and Afghans have always stood for each other, never against another.
You have been at the crossroads of history.
And, your history tells us that you will never let yourself become a theatre of competition; or serve the designs of others.
For you live by the creed extolled by poet Kushal Khan Khattak that Nation’s honor and nation’s fame on life they have a prior claim.
So, with your faith and at your pace, India will continue to build Afghan capacity for governance, security and development, so that you can build a future that Afghans so richly deserve.
We will do this from the responsibility that comes from our friendship.
But, we also do this with a commitment to peace and stability in our region.
We know that Afghanistan’s success will require the cooperation and support of each of its neighbours.
And, all of us in the region – India, Pakistan, Iran and others – must unite, in trust and cooperation, behind this common purpose and in recognition of our common destiny.
When Afghanistan becomes a haven of peace and a hub for the flow of ideas, commerce, energy and investments in the region, we will all prosper together.
That is why we are working to improve your connectivity by land and sea, including through Chahbahar in Iran.
That is why I hope that Pakistan will become a bridge between South Asia and Afghanistan and beyond.
I hope that the day will come soon when energy from Central Asia will power prosperity in our region; when a Kabuliwala can once again come across easily to win Indian hearts; when we in India can relish the wonderful fruits of Afghanistan; when Afghans do not have to pay an enormous price to buy their favourite products from India.
For this has always been the course of this region’s history.
And, it must be the path to its future.
But, brave and tireless as the Afghans are in defending their nations, Afghanistan will succeed only when terrorism no longer flows across the border; when nurseries and sanctuaries of terrorism are shut; and, their patrons are no longer in business.
Terror and violence cannot be the instrument to shape Afghanistan’s future or dictate the choices Afghans make..
For, the fire that is lit in Afghanistan, can never be contained, within these boundaries.
Afghans have the wisdom to seek peace with neighbours, but also the courage to defend their freedom.
And, Afghans of all persuasions must have the right to seek peace among themselves.
Too much blood has flown down Kabul River.
Too many tragedies have darkened the mountain slopes.
Too many dreams have burnt in the fire of a senseless conflict.
You can be Pushtoons, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras.
You can be Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs.
But, you are proud Afghans who can come together as one nation and one people.
You may have fought in the name of religion; or in the cause of identity.
But, it is now time for Afghans to come together in peace.
As a wise Afghan said, A tree with a bitter seed, Fed with butter and sugar, Will still bear a bitter fruit.
You have a glorious tradition of pluralism and respect for diversity and beliefs.
Those who have destroyed homes must now rebuild their nation.
For, this is your land and these are your people.
And, it must be on your terms, on your genius, through your own process and your own spirit of brotherhood.
Not driven by the calculations or ambitions of others.
And, the future you build in peace and through dialogue must preserve the hard-won progress of the last decade and half.
It must have a place for every Afghan.
It must have space for everyone’s aspiration.
And, it must be a nation, where every citizen is secure of her rights and confident about her future.
And, as Afghans take responsibility for their future, the world must stand with them in solidarity and support.
We must do that for the soldier from a foreign land who laid down his life in an Afghan village that he had never heard of and for a people he had never known; and, for the enormous sacrifices that Afghans have made for a life that others take for granted.
We must support Afghanistan without time lines because the new clouds of extremism and terrorism are rising, even as the old ones continue to darken our skies; and, because Afghans are not only fighting for their future, but are standing up for all of us and a safer world.
The world will be a better place when we can experience the real wealth of Afghan people in their diversity and rich heritage.
It is time for all Afghans, everyone in the region and the rest of the world to come together.
The sacrifices must not go in vain.
The flame of hope should not die.
No girl that steps into the world should slip into darkness of denied opportunities.
No son should face the choice of gun or refuge in a distant land.
No mother should fear bringing a child into this world.
No leader should lose a brother because he spoke for Afghan freedom to choose friends.
No one kneeling in prayer in a mosque should be killed in the name of religion.
No elder should look back on his youth wasted in conflict, and see the same future for his grandchild.
Every youth in Afghanistan should see a future in which IT stands for information technology, not international terrorism.
For, the promise and the opportunities of the 21st century belong to Afghan youth as much as anyone else in the world.
For India, this is a deeply held commitment.
Your suffering is our pain.
Your dreams are our duty.
Your strength is our belief.
Your courage is our inspiration.
Above all, your friendship is our honour.
And, as Hindi cinema’s most famous Pathan character, Sher Khan in Zanjeer sang,
Friendship is my faith, the friend is my life.
This is the creed of Afghans and Indians.
I am confident that Hope will return to your homes, Laughter in your schools, Life in your streets, Prosperity in your cities, unity in your society and peace in your nation.
And, at every step of your journey, India will be with you.
Thank you again for this great honour and privilege.

We have set time bound goals for providing access to housing, water, electricity and sanitation for all.
Thus, India is now the next frontier of economic revolution.
The campaigns like Digital India and Skill India are designed to prepare the people to take part in this process.
We have witnessed massive growth in the number of start-ups in the recent past.
Some of these have begun to challenge established global players.
This share must reach around 25% in the short and medium term.
With this in view, we have launched the “Make in India” initiative.
We are also divesting our stake in the public sector enterprises, to instill market discipline.
We are consistently working to integrate our economy with the rest of the world.
I hope to further dedicate the next three months to address even the remotest issues affecting free flow of capital and business to India.
Thank you for welcoming me with such warmth and affection.
Your love and affection makes my visit to this great country all the more special.
On NarendraModi App I received thousands of innovative and useful suggestions.
And these suggestions have helped me to enrich my interaction with you today.
But, our common cultural, religious and spiritual heritage ensured that we remain close and connected.
Both, in our hearts and our minds,
They faced hardship and extreme poverty.
Yet, they endured and kept going.
They also gave them new wings to flourish.
And, today, the beauty of Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Urdu and Telugu continues to enrich the fabric of South African society.
The colours of Holi, the sparkle of Diwali, tastes of Pongal, and festivities of Eid are not just the rainbow of Indian cultural traditions.
They also symbolize the vibrant diversity of South Africa.
Its reality rests in your immense contribution to the economic and social well-being of this great country.
Not many of you may recognize, but there is one contribution of your ancestors, that you should be proud of.
In many ways, what Indian diaspora stands for all over the world today is because of what your forefathers were able to achieve despite all adversities.
This city and its people mean a lot to us.
It was here that Mahatma Gandhi conceptualised his politics.
This is the birthplace of Satyagraha.
South Africa transformed Mohandas into a Mahatma.
But, Gandhi was not alone in his fight against racial oppression.
The South African freedom struggle also has many heroes among you.
Who can forget the sacrifice of sixteen year old Valliamma, the fearless Thambi Naidoo and the selfless Mohammed Cachalia?
I had the privilege of meeting Ahmed Kathrada earlier today.
He spent 26 years in prison alongside Nelson Mandela.
I salute you all, and the countless others, dedicated to this country.
You are also a part of the flourishing global Indian family.
You form a unique bond between our two great nations.
A bond that is nurtured by our shared values and struggles.
A bond on whose foundation we are building the promise of our prosperous future.
It is the land of Madiba , and the कर्मभूमि of Mahatma Gandhi.
The path these two great men have shown us, and the freedom that they have won for us, is an inspiration for all of mankind.
Their tireless spirit, courage and moral force will remain a guiding beacon for the generations to come.
The forgiveness of Nelson Mandela and his Long March to Freedom gave rise to A Rainbow Nation.
Gandhi held South Africa dear to his heart.
We live in a world that is inter-dependent and hyper-connected.
Many of you are now closely engaged with developments in India.
Your desire to connect with the lands of your forefathers may be an emotional urge.
But, you need not limit yourself to that alone.
India, today, is also a land of opportunity for those who want to:
In a world marked by reducing growth rates and economic slowdown, India has registered a healthy growth rate of 7.6% this year.
We are working to grow over 8% and more in the years ahead.
And, is defined by our commitment to change the face of the Indian economy.
Transformations that aim to uplift:
We want enterprises to flourish, businesses to grow and the country to rise.
For this, we are already shaping a policy framework that strengthens India’s ability to build trade, manufacturing, innovation and investment partnerships with other countries in the world.
Our focus on Ease of Doing Business is aimed at ensuring that the public, private and personal businesses can grow to their full potential in India.
And, we want it to be driven by state of the art infrastructure.
Backed by the strength of the best information technology specialists in the world, we are also shaping a digital revolution.
A revolution that would change the way:
India, like South Africa is a young nation.
The energy and drive of our 800 million youth fuels and mirrors the ambition and aspiration of the entire country.
We want them to be the engine that pulls India’s economy and society.
And, for this, we are working in campaign mode to skill India’s youth.
The plan is to generate over 500 million new jobs in India by 2022.
There is a wave of new momentum in our villages.
The cities are full of enterprise and energy.
In doing so they opted for:
Our two countries have similar aspirations and challenges.
India was one of the leaders of the international movement for freedom in this country.
We led from the front in the global fight against Apartheid.
But, as I said earlier, as the Rainbow nation was born, we were also the first ones to extend the warm embrace of our friendship.
With this, began a new and glorious chapter in our ties.
In our economic choices, we can do many things together for our youth and for our people.
Both India and South Africa, have huge demographic opportunities.
We both have a young population.
Two-thirds of our people in India are below the age of 35.
Similar is the story on the African continent, and in South Africa.
We must share our experiences, our partnership and our expertise to meet our development goals.
India is ready to join you in this journey.
Our development and business partnerships are already doing well.
But we must do more to help them gallop, to run as the springbok.
Together we can create new enterprises, new skills and new social values.
India and South Africa are strategic partners.
We should build a partnership that spans the entirety of the human endeavour.
A partnership that scales new heights in diverse fields:
Together, we can also create new values for our friends in Africa.
Our companies are already partnering and bringing economic benefit to our people.
They can also be instrument of change on this continent.
We can work together, to empower youth, to fight poverty, malnutrition, disease and hunger.
Again, not just in our countries, but across Africa and other developing regions.
We live in an age of global challenges.
Fight against terrorism and piracy, AIDS and Ebola are some of the key priorities of our partnership.
Our partnership for economic prosperity also has to be sensitive to Climate Change.
We agreed to a landmark deal in Paris.
We now have to work together as strong partners to look at new energy pathways and technology solutions for a climate smart world.
A resurgent India awaits you.
And, we have taken several steps towards eliminating barriers of entry.
The OCI and PIO schemes have been rolled into one.
In February this year we launched e-visa for South Africa.
You can now get Indian visa sitting at home in your email, and that too at no cost!
Brothers and Sisters, India and South Africa have much to benefit from a closer partnership.
You are a window to India’s heritage, to our ethos and to our values.
And, you form an important life line for our ties with this land.
In conclusion, let me say that your achievements, your contributions and your success makes us all proud.
It has been a privilege for me to connect with you.

“Very sad to hear about the demise of Narayanbhai Bhandari, a veteran professor in Ahmedabad and someone I interacted with very closely.
Till his final moments, Narayanbhai was always connected to his students.
His exemplary personality will be remembered forever,” the Prime Minister said.
My colleague in the council of Ministers, Minister of State for Corporate Affairs, Shri PP Chaudhary Ji,
President of Institute of Company Secretaries of India, Dr. Shyam Agrawal Ji and other dignitaries present on this occasion.
ICSI is celebrating its 50th anniversary today.
My heartfelt greetings to all those associated with the institution on this occasion.
Your institution reminds such people of the values from this lesson of Satyam Vada, Dharmam Chara.
Your institution plays an important role in institutionalizing the transparency and honesty in the country.
Brothers and sisters, Acharya Chanakya had said:
Friends, this axiom applies in the context of the nation as well.
A handful of people in our country have been engaged in harming its reputation, they have been trying to weaken our honest social fabric.
The Government has launched a campaign to clean-up the system and the institutions from such elements once it assumed office.
-Tax treaties with several new countries were signed and earlier tax agreements were amended.
New ways were found in consultation with them.
– Insolvency and Bankruptcy Codes were enacted.
– Benami Property Law that had been lying in limbo for 28 years, was implemented.
– Good And Simple Tax- GST – that was stuck up for several years was put in place.
– This is the government that has shown the courage to take the decision of Demonetization.
Brothers and sisters, This government has worked to strengthen the institutional probity in the country.
As a result of relentless hard work by this government alone, we are having a less cash economy.
Was it possible if a new era of honesty had not been ushered in the country, in the economy of the country?
This character, Shalya always used to discourage those who were in the battle field and spread despair.
He used to say, you don’t have the courage, your horses and chariot are weak and how would you fight.
Shalya belonged to the Mahabharata era.
But still we have some people having the same Shalya mentality.
Such people take pleasure in spreading the despair.
The slowdown in the GDP even in one quarter has become the biggest news item these days for such people.
Friends, When the data suits their thinking, the institutions and processes appear correct to them.
However, the moment, the same data is unsuitable for them, they immediately start questioning the institutions and its processes.
If you look at the two preceding years before 2014 such as 2012-13 and 2013-14, the average growth rate was around 6%.
Now some people may ask why I have picked up those two years only.
Because, it won’t take much time for people with Shalya mentality to contest it.
Brothers and sisters, I’m not an economist and neither have I ever claimed so.
However, today when so much of discussion is taking place about the economy, I would like to take you back in time.
You must be aware about thar around that time the issues hogging limelight were –the growth in the inflation rate rather than GDP growth, while growth in current account deficit and fiscal deficit were prominently in the news.
Growth in the rate of Dollar vis a vis Rupee used to be the headline in the newspapers while the growth of interest rate was animatedly debated .
At that time, these parameters which reverse the growth trajectory of the nation were the favourite of a handful of people.
Now when the same parameters have shown marked improvements, development is in the right direction, a handful of people are still having a look at it with their colored vision.
Can you compare 10% with 2.5%.
Current Account Deficit which was 4% has come down to nearly 1%.
You can see it.
While improving upon the parameters, the Central Government has brought down the fiscal deficit from 4.5% under the previous regime to 3.5%.
Foreign investors have made record investments in India today.
Friends, it is correct that despite attaining average growth rate of 7.5% over the past three years, GDP growth rate in April-June period this year saw a decline.
We don’t deny it.
The financial stability of the country will be maintained.
We would take every step to bring in more investments. and carry forward the momentum of growth.
I would like to assure that the steps taken by the Government would help India move into a new league in the years to come.
Let me assure you that any such thing is not going to happen.
It might have happened with the earlier regime, since the rules at that time, their attitude and behavior was different.
And hence, our Government is of the view that we welcome those who wish to join the mainstream.
I would also like to tell about the GST.
We have seen closely what is working and what is not.
We have sought feedback even on minor issues.
Friends, while discussing the state of economy with you, I would like to share the following details.
I leave it to you to judge the implications of these details.
Friends, I have a firm belief that whenever you bought a new car, you won’t have purchased it under compulsion.
This is the basic thinking of our society.
These indicators reflect the growth in demand in urban areas.
· Hence, if we look at indicators related to rural demand then the sale of tractors has registered a growth of over 34% in the recent months.
· Even in the FMCG sector, the trend of growth in demand is on the upside in the month of September.
·-If we have a look at the recently released data, the production of coal, electricity, steel and natural gas has registered a robust growth.
·-Friends, even the disbursal of personal loan has registered rapid growth.
· The loans given by Housing Finance Companies and Non-Banking Finance Companies have registered significant growth.
-· Not only this, there is more investment in the mutual funds and insurance sector in the capital market.
· Companies have mobilized more than 25000 crore rupees in the first six months of this year through the IPOs.
During the entire period of last year this figure was Rs. 29000 crore.
· In less than four months, more than 45,000 crore rupees have been invested in Non-Financial Entities through corporate bonds and private placement.
-This data reflects the broad base of financing in the country.
It means that financing in India is no longer confined to bank loans alone.
-Friends, This government has continuously emphasized on the proper utilization of both time and resources.
One can see a clear difference in the pace of work during the three years of the previous government and this government.
· 80 thousand kilometers long rural roads were constructed during the last three years of the previous government.
During the three years of our government, 1 lakh 20 thousand kilometers long rural roads have been constructed.
It means a growth of 50% in the construction of rural roads.
-The previous Government during its last three years, had awarded the work to construct 15,000 kilometers long national highways.
Our government has awarded the work to construct 34,000 kilometers long national highways in its three years.
It means this government has nearly doubled the investment.
Even you would be aware that how many administrative and financial steps are needed to be taken by the government for construction of highways.
This data reflects that how the government has performed the role of a policy maker and policy implementer after bringing the country out of policy paralysis.
It means a growth of over 75%.
If we talk about the three years of this government, then more than 22,000 megawatt renewable energy capacity has been connected to the grid power.
It means that this government’s performance in this sector is nearly two times better.
·During the last three years of the previous government, it spent nearly Rs. 4,000 on the renewable energy.
Our government has spent more than Rs. 10,600 crores in this sector in the three years.
·If we talk about the growth of shipping industry during the previous government, then the growth in cargo handling was negative during its tenure whereas during the three years of this government, it has registered an increase of 11%.
Friends, The government has been paying full attention for strengthening the social infrastructure of the country along with the strengthening of physical infrastructure related to important sectors like rail-road and electricity.
We have taken major policy decisions and carried out financial reforms in the field of affordable housing which are unprecedented for the sector.
Friends, during the last three years of the previous government, it approved the projects worth Rs. 15,000 crores.
While this government has cleared projects worth Rs. 1.53 lakh crores during its first three years.
This is a reflection of our commitment to provide houses to the poor people, to the middle class.
Brothers and sisters, More capital investment is required for this kind of developmental work that is taking place across the country.
The government has stressed upon bringing more foreign investment in the country.
-You might be aware that when the issue of reforms in the insurance sector was first discussed, the newspaper headlines used to say that if such a thing happens, it would be a major economic decision.
It was during the previous government.
-I would like to tell those people who have made this word – Reform – their theme song that we have carried out 87 small and big reforms in 21 sectors.
Big changes have been brought about in the investment policies related to several sectors including construction sector, defence sector, financial services, food processing , or other sectors you name it.
If you compare the total amount of foreign investment in India that has come after the liberalization and the foreign investment made during the last three years, you will realize the impact of economic reforms carried out by our government.
Friends, this government realizes the value of every single penny earned by your hard work.
Friends, This is the result of the government’s constant efforts that a LED bulb which was priced at Rs. 350 during the previous government, has now been brought down to Rs. 40-45 under the Ujala scheme by this government.
Now you tell me, whether it resulted in savings for a middle class or a poor person or not.
·So far more than 26 crore LED bulbs have been distributed in the country.
It has resulted in the estimated savings worth Rs. 14,000 crores to the middle class families in just one year.
As per an estimate, the municipality of a tier-two town has made on an average saving Rs. 10-15 crore.
Now this money. is being spent for the development of the cities and spurring economic growth. .
– For the first time, the middle class has been given relief on the interest rates for construction of houses by this Government.
You might recall, never before middle class was granted relief for construction of houses.
I am being criticized.
The vested interests feel aggrieved since my Government believes in transferring the money into the accounts of the beneficiaries through Direct Benefit transfer.
It has ensured that ghost accounts are done away with.
That is why such people won’t like PM Modi .
That is why our emphasis is on empowering the common man.
I would like to tell my fellow citizens humbly that I cannot compromise with the future of the country to protect my present.
That is why this government is extending every possible help to the youth who want to do something on their own, who want to fulfill their dreams.
· Loans of more than Rs. 3.75 lakh crore have been given to more than 9 crore account holders without any bank guarantee under the Mudra scheme.
· Out of these 9 crore people, 2.63 crores are the youth who are the first time borrowers, it means that this is for the first time that they borrowed a loan under the Mudra scheme to start their business.
The government has been encouraging the self employment through the schemes like Skill India Mission, Stand-up India and Start-up India.
Companies have been given financial incentives for bringing more and more people in the formal economy.
In the last three years, this number has gone up to 4.80 crore.
Some people forget this thing that this number cannot go up without growth in employment.
Friends, We have taken steps to ensure that the Government schemes bring in a qualitative change in the lives of poor people, lower middle class and middle class people.
Nearly 15 crore poor people have been brought under the coverage of government insurance schemes.
The Saubhagya Scheme has been launched a few days ago to provide free electricity connections to the poor people.
These schemes have been empowering the poor people.
Now it is the need of the hour for you all to play an active role in producing a new business culture.
Nearly 19 lakh new citizens have come under the scope of indirect taxes following the implementation of GST.
It will open up a new avenue of employment.
If it is taken up in organized way, even one lakh would be small number.
Friends, nation celebrates 75 years of independence in 2022.
These promises will have your pledges and you should fulfill it- .
· Can you take the responsibility of making the country a high tax compliant society by 2022?
· Can you ensure that there will not be a single shell company in the country by 2022?
· Can you ensure that by 2022 every company in the country will honestly pay the taxes?
Once again, Congratulations to you all in this Golden Jubilee Year.
I would like to assure my fellow citizens that we do not take offence to the recent spate of criticisms of the Government on the economic front.
I would like to express my deepest appreciation to the Government of Vietnam and its leadership for the warm welcome extended to me and to the members of my delegation.
These cultural bonds reflect themselves in many ways.
Most prominently, in the connect between Buddhism and the monuments of the Hindu Cham civilization.
There can be no better example of this than in the success of our multifaceted bilateral cooperation with Vietnam over the last four decades.
The Cuu Long Delta Rice Research Institute, is a prime example of the enormous impact of our cooperation.
India helped set up the institute in the Mekong Delta, sending agricultural experts and training its faculty in India.
Today, Vietnam is the world’s third largest rice exporter.
We are happy to have partnered with Vietnam in its emergence as a major rice producing and exporting country.
As two partners, we must also take advantage of our synergies to jointly face emerging regional challenges, and to exploit new opportunities.
In a few months from now we will jointly commemorate these milestones.
I believe that a strong India-Vietnam partnership would lead to prosperity, development, peace and stability for our people, and in the wider region.
Vietnam is a strong pillar of India’s Act East Policy.
Our bilateral ties are based on strong mutual trust, and understanding, and convergence of views on various regional and international issues.
Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,
It gives me great pleasure to invite you to join me in a toast:

The research work relating to this archaeological discovery is being published in the form of articles in the Palevol Review.

I am also grateful for the generous hospitality extended to me and my delegation.
Today, on day four of my visit to four African countries, it is indeed a pleasure to be in this vibrant city of Dar-es-Salaam.
Excellency, I am in agreement what you just said about the strengths and future potential of our relationship.
The Eastern coast of Africa, and Tanzania in particular have enjoyed strong links with the India.
We are old maritime neighbours.
Our merchants have traded since early nineteenth century.
And, the vast stretch of Indian Ocean has kept our societies and our people connected.
I am deeply grateful to President Magufuli for agreeing to my visit on a Sunday.
It is a tribute to his motto of “Hapa kazi tu”, meaning-here work only.
India is already a substantial economic partner of Tanzania.
The whole range of our economic ties are healthy and on upswing.
• Our two way annual trade stands at around US$ 3 billion;
• Indian investments in Tanzania already total around US$ 3 billion; and
• Indian businesses in Tanzania continue to grow and expand.
We consider it our privilege to be a trusted partner in meeting Tanzania’s development priorities.
Today, President Magufuli and I held detailed discussions on the full spectrum of our partnership.
Our focus was to shape an action oriented agenda of cooperation, so that we talk less of potential and more of achievements on the ground.
For this, both of us felt that we need to:
• Two, work together in development and use of natural gas;
• Four, deepen our trade and investment partnership by encouraging greater industry to industry ties.
As a developing country, India understands the need and urgency to improve the lives of our people.
And, as a friend, what you want to achieve for your people would also be the focus of our efforts.
In this regard, the completion of 100 million dollar water supply augmentation project for Dar es Salaam is a good achievement.
We have just now also signed an agreement on water supply project in Zanzibar for a line of credit of $92 million.
We are also working on a number of other water projects for 17 cities.
And for this India is willing to consider an additional $500 million line of concessional credit Public Health is another important area of our engagement.
I am told that an Indian radio-therapy machine is being installed at Bugando medical centre to treat cancer patients.
I also understand that the IT Resource Centre at the Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science & Technology, Arusha is close to completion.
India’s cooperation with Tanzania will always be as per your needs and priorities.

We in India have had the honour to receive every President of Tanzania.
I look forward to welcoming President Magufuli in India at the earliest possible opportunity.
Let me in the end thank you Excellency the President for your friendship and for receiving me so warmly.
The Cabinet also approved the Renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) & The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales
It is a matter of great pride that a number of Indian Chartered Accountants are holding top level positions in companies in UK and with the recognition from ICAEW the Corporates in UK would be trusting Indian talents and skills more to hire them.There are no financial implications for the Government of India.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the valedictory session of the function to mark National Law Day – 2017, at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi.
He described the Constitution as the very soul of our democratic structure.
He said the Day is an occasion to pay homage to the makers of the Constitution.
He said the Constitution has stood the test of time, and proved the naysayers wrong.
The Prime Minister quoted extensively from leaders including Dr. B.R Ambedkar, Dr. Sachidanand Sinha, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, and Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, during his address.
These quotations were used to highlight several important facets of the Constitution, and governance.

My Dear Countrymen, Namaskar
ShivaKumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to Social Service.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us, “Kayakave Kailas”” meaning discahrging one’s duties with due dilligence and persevereance is akin to being in the abode of Lord Shiva ie Kailasha Dham.
ShivaKumar Swamiji was a true follower of this tenet … during his life spanning a hundred and eleven years, he strived tirelessly towards the social, educational and economic upliftment of thousands of people .
He was renowned to be a masterly scholar of languages such as English, Sanskrit and Kannada.
He dedicated his life in ensuring that food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge reached out to people.
The welfare of farmers was a priority in his life.
The Siddhganga Mutt regularily used to organise cattle and agricultural fairs.
I have had the fortunate opportunity to be blessed by Swamiji, many a time.
In the year 2007 on the occasion of the Centenary celebration of Sri Sri Sri Shivakumar Swamiji our former President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam had paid a visit to Tumukur.
On this occasion Kalam Saheb had recited a poem dedicated to revered Swamiji.
“O my Fellow Citizens – In giving, you receive happiness,
In Body and Soul- You have everything to give,
If you have knowledge – share it,
Dr. Kalam Saheb’s poem potrays the life of Shri Shri Shri Shivakumar Swamiji and the mission of the Siddhganga Mutt beautifully.
Yesterday, we celebrated Republic Day with pride and fervour.
But today I want to speak to you on a totally different aspect.
Our Country leaves, no stone unturned to ensure that every citizen of India who is a registered voter, rightfully avails of the opportunity to cast his vote.
Whereas we hear of a polling station at 15,000 feet above mean sea level in Himachal Pradesh we also learn about the same being organised in remote islands of the Andaman Nicobar archipelago.
And you must have heard about Gujarat … in a remote place in Gir forest, there is a polling booth for a sole voter.
Just imagine … for that one and only voter!
These facts are bound to instil a sense of pride, of the commitment of the Election Commission.
I appreciate the Election Commission for relentlessly striving to ensure the strengthening of our democracy.
I hold in high esteem, the Election Commissions of all states, security personnel and other staff members who contribute in ensuring strict adherence to free and fair polling.
This year, our Country will undergo Lok Sabha elections.
The first time ever, young persons born in the 21st Century will exercise their Right to Vote in the Lok Sabha Elections.
They face the opportunity to shoulder responsibilities pertaining to the Country.
They have embarked upon the journey of being partners in Nation building.
The time has come for a confluence of individual dreams and the Nation’s dream.
I urge the young generation to register themselves as voters, if they are eligible.
Our country is ‘Bahuratna vasundhara’ … the land of myriad gems.
One among them was Netaji Subash Chandra Bose.
On the 23rd of January, the country celebrated the birth anniversary of Netaji in an uncommon, special manner.
On this occasion I was fortunate to get an opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to heroes who fought in India’s freedom struggle.
You may be aware of the fact that inside Red Fort, many chambers and structures lay locked & unused for several decades after Independence.
Those very chambers have now been turned into exquisite museums.
A museum dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army; Yaad-e-Jalian, reminiscences of Jalianwala Bagh and 1857 – India’s first war of Independence constitute the premises of ‘Kranti Mandir’, that has been dedicated to the nation.
Every inch, every brick of these museums is redolent with the fragrance of our glorious history.
Tales of valour of the heroes of our freedom struggle emanating from every nook & corner of these museums inspire us to delve deeper into our history.
This was the very site where three heroic sons of Mother India – Col. Prem Sehgal, Col. Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan had to face a trial under British Rule.
On my visit to Kranti Mandir, Red Fort, as I was reflecting on memories of Netaji, his family members gifted me a special cap.
There was a time when Netaji used to wear it.
I dedicated that cap to the museum itself, for visitors to see and be inspired with the spirit of patriotism.
The fact is, stories of the valour and patriotism of our heroes should be told and re-told to our newer generations in ways more than one.
Just a month ago, on the 30th of December, I had gone to Andaman & Nicobar islands.
At an event, our tricolour was unfurled at the very site where Netaji Subhash Bose had unfurled it exactly 75 years ago.
In a similar manner, when the tricolour was hoisted at the Red Fort in October 2018, it surprised everyone, since conventionally, this is done on the 15th of August.
The occasion was the completion of 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Through his clarion calls ‘Dilli Chalo’, ‘Tum mujhe Khoon do, main tumhe azadi doonga’, Netaji secured a special place in every Indian’s heart.
That files associated with Netaji be declassified has been a long standing demand for years.
And I am happy that we could manage to do the same.
I remember the day when Netaji’s family paid a visit to the Prime Minister’s residence.
We dwelt at length on myriad facets of Netaji Subhash Bose, offering him tributes.
It gladdens me to see many places associated with illustrious sons of India being developed in Delhi.
Be it 26, Alipur Road, associated with Babasaheb Ambedkar, or the Sardar Patel museum or the Kranti Mandir!
Whenever you come to Delhi, you must pay a visit to these places.
My dear countrymen, today as we refer to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, that too in ‘Mann Ki Baat’, I would like to share with you an incident from Netaji’s life.
I have always considered Radio as an effective means of connecting with people.
Similarly, Netaji shared a deep bond with the medium of Radio and he chose this very medium to converse with countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu established Azad Hind Radio and through it he used to communicate with soldiers of the Indian National Army and other countrymen.
Subhash Babu had a distinct style of opening a broadcast.
I am told this radio station also used to broadcast weekly news bulletins in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto & Urdu languages.
In managing the affairs of this radio station, a resident of Gujarat M.R. Vyas ji played a vital role.
In this very Kranti Mandir, a visual arts museum has been established.
India’s art & culture has been portrayed here in a very attractive way.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I am happy to be here today at the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
Let me begin by congratulating Romesh Wadhwani ji and Sunil Wadhwani ji,The Government of Maharashtra, and Mumbai University for coming together to make this Institute a reality.
This is a prime example of how the public sector and the private sector can combine with good intention to build a world-class institute aimed at benefiting the poor.
I have had various interactions with Indian diaspora across the globe during the last three and a half years or so.
I have felt an intense desire, to make a contribution to India.
Through this Institute, Romesh ji and Sunil ji have blended this desire with a futuristic vision of a prosperous and vibrant India.
In doing so, they have set an example that is worthy of emulation.
Friends, today India is one of the fastest growing economies of the world.
We are using technology in an un-paralleled way from agriculture to aeronautics and from space missions to service delivery.
We are also witnessing a wave of entrepreneurship ranging from small enterprises to big-ticket investments.
Friends, with the arrival of Artificial Intelligence, Bots and Robots there is no doubt that our productivity will further go up.
Such fears are neither un-founded nor new.
At every stage of technological evolution, we have faced such doubts and questions.
This leads to two views of the future.
First brings hopes and aspirations and second brings fears of disruption.
Technology opens entirely new spheres and sectors for growth.
It also opens up an entirely new paradigm of opportunities.
With each wave of new technology, many new opportunities arise.
The spirit of scientific enquiry was rooted in the pursuit of Truth.
The road ahead for Artificial Intelligence depends on and will be driven by Human Intentions.
It is this ethic of development that will ensure equity for all peoples.
The March of Technology cannot be at the expense of further increasing the difference between societies over access to technology.
The evolution of Technology has to be rooted in the ethic of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
Friends, at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Human understanding is the solution of many problems we are facing.
We need to make Artificial Intelligence in India and Make Artificial Intelligence work for India.
I would urge all of you to identify the grand challenges that Artificial Intelligence can solve for India.
We are such a diverse nation of tens of languages and hundreds of dialects.
Can we have intelligent Artificial Intelligence that makes communication and conversations across these languages and dialects easier?
Can we have Artificial Intelligence and Robotics that enhances their abilities empowering them to perform tasks and bring out their true potential?
Can the combination of teachers and Artificial Intelligence help us bridge the gap in teacher student ratio?
This will help us deliver quality education to every student across India.
Can Artificial Intelligence help us take quality healthcare to every corner of India by expanding capacities of our healthcare workers?
Can Artificial Intelligence help us predict natural calamities?
Can Artificial Intelligence help us detect serious health conditions before they manifest physically?
Can Artificial Intelligence help our farmers make the right decisions regarding weather, crop and sowing cycle?
Friends, our Government is of the firm belief, that we can use this power of twenty-first century technology to eradicate poverty and disease.
In doing so, we can bring prosperity to our poor and under-privileged sections.
Under Bharat-Net, we are providing broad-band Internet connectivity to our villages.
This digital infrastructure provides the backbone for innovative IT solutions for service delivery, and innovative applications.
The Union Government’s National Skill Development Mission is also aimed to ensuring a rightly-skilled workforce, keeping in mind global job requirements of the next few decades.
We have also launched the Atal Innovation Mission to promote a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.
Its objective is to serve as a platform for promotion of world-class Innovation Hubs, Grand Challenges, Start-up businesses and other self-employment activities, particularly in technology driven areas.
The Atal Innovation Mission is establishing Atal Tinkering Laboratories in schools across India with a vision to encourage one million children in India to become young innovators.
Through these steps, we aim to keep pace with emerging technologies so that they can be used for the benefit of our people.
Friends, I am sure, the scientists, researchers and pioneers at this Institute, will have the best interests of the common people of India in their hearts, as they go about their work.
I wish them well in their efforts.
I hope that India shall be in a unique position to show the entire world how Artificial Intelligence can be applied safely and responsibly for the benefit of the people.

What moves me today, is your electrifying presence, full of excitement and enthusiasm for this important international sports event on the banks of the mighty Brahmaputra.
Guwahati has come a long way since the days of Pragjyotishpur in Ancient India.
Young people in the North-East and especially here in Assam do not miss any opportunity to witness a good football match.
This fame has spread so far and wide that the FIFA World Cup Under-17 which will be hosted first time in India in 2017 has chosen Guwahati as a prime venue for the event.
This sports meet, for me signifies a perfect blend of 3 Ts – Talent, Teamwork and Togetherness.
Among us is the best and most youthful talent from across South Asia.
You are proud members of your team – it can be your team of the sport you play and a larger team of the nation you are representing.
And, at the same time this meet also celebrates togetherness of all South Asian nations.
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka – no matter which country we are from, we all call South Asia our home.
Sports has to be an essential part of an individual’s life.
A good game is both healthy and refreshing.
Without sports, there cannot be any sportsman spirit.
This sportsman spirit will not only help you on the field but also in other aspects of your life.
You will cherish whatever you learn on the sports field for your entire life.
I always say – Jo Khele, woh Khile.
The person who plays, shines.
The mascot of these games ‘TIKHOR‘represents a baby rhino who is sharp and intelligent.
It captures the spirit of sports persons and young sport lovers.
The theme song of the games is “Ei prithivi ekhan krirangan, krira hol shantir prangan” sung by legendary late Dr. Bhupen Hazarika.
A singer whose captivating voice left people spellbound; his song beautifully captures the spirit of South Asian Games, the spirit of peace, friendship and prosperity.
I have been told by Shri Sarbananda Sonowalji that the Organizing Committee for the Games has brought waters from each of the eight SAARC countries and these waters will be merged to signify shared aspirations and cooperative spirit amongst the SAARC Nations.
Dr. Bhupen Hazarika’s song “We are in the same boat brother” which you are going to hear soon is all about SAARC Nations.
We should join hands together as a family.
Let us kindle this spirit of friendship through sports in South Asian Games.
My vision for South Asia is the same as my vision for India – Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
All South Asian countries are partners in our journey towards development.
I am sure that as the Games proceed, this feeling of friendship trust and understanding will convert itself not only into sporting opportunities but also into business and tourism opportunities as well.
Let these Games become a spring board for bringing peace and prosperity in the region through business, interaction and sporting activities.
Let this be an opportunity for SAARC people to realize their potential.
Sportsmanship is a philosophy of life harmonizing in a balanced whole the qualities of endurance, will and mind.
The challenge for performance, the joy of effort, the cheer of success, the spirit of friendship and fairplay in a sports arena speak volumes about how culture, education, ethics, dignity and society get intertwined with each other during such sports events.
On the sports field, we can forget what separates us, and we can truly connect with each other in the spirit of sportsmanship and adventure.
We can celebrate our diversity, and at the same time, be united under common rules for our sports, and the shared values of honesty and fair play.
The friendships you would form over these 12 days, and the memories you take back will last you a lifetime.
I am confident that you will cherish these bonds, and become Ambassadors for peace and friendship between our nations.
While people play for medals and provide tough competition to each other, I urge the sports-persons and visitors here to take time from their busy schedules to visit the places of tourism attraction and wonderful wildlife sanctuaries nearby.
Once again I welcome our friends from SAARC countries.
Let the competition be in true sports man spirit.
May the best win.

It is an essential foundation of growth and stability in the global economy.
In India, Government and the Central Bank, are taking steps to further strengthen the financial and banking sector.
As we work on this important issue in G20, I wish to highlight a few points.

I welcome the promotion of transparency and integrity in the private sector.
We need greater international cooperation for return of illicit money to the country of origin.
We must address the barriers of excessive banking secrecy, and complex legal and regulatory frameworks.

Country specific reports of FATF should be shared and FATF should work out a mechanism to work with deficient countries.

I particularly recall my interactions during my visit to Hannover Fair in April 2015.
India was Partner Country in that fair.
Germany ranks 7th among foreign investor countries in India.
They provide employment to around two hundred thousand people.
However, there is tremendous further potential in India-Germany economic collaboration.
Our economic partnership is still below its full potential.
To enhance this, we, in India, are ready with open arms to welcome German companies.
With a view to help the German companies, we have put in place a Fast Track Mechanism.
We are on the path of making India a global manufacturing hub.
Already a good eco-system exists in India for manufacturing.
A vast pool of skilled professionals with knowledge and energy;
World class engineering education base and strong R&D facilities;
Rise in GDP and purchasing power creating further growth in the domestic market;
One of the most liberal FDI Policy regimes in the world;
Government’s focus on easing the business environment further.
Due to these strengths, as said by UNIDO, India is already the 6th largest manufacturing nation in the world.
To make it better, we are working hard on various enablers.
Through our ‘Make in India’ initiative, we are committed to transform India as a major player in the global value chain.
Prime motive is creation of jobs and narrowing the gap between affluent and lower sections of society.
Make in India has already created a strong impact.
Germany is contributing in a big way in the success of Make in India.
Particularly, India’s participation as Partner country in the Hannover Fair has given a big boost to Indo-German partnership.
During the Hannover Messe, specific areas for collaboration were mutually identified.
This included manufacturing, skill development, railways, cleaning of rivers, renewable energy, education, science and technology.
In addition, we are also implementing a strategic market entry support Programme, since September 2015.
It is called MIIM (Make in India Mittelstand).
This is mainly to assist German Mittelstand Companies in entering the Indian Market.
The MIIM Programme has been offering a wide range of business support Services.
The initiative has resulted in growing interest of German companies in India.
The outcomes are that in this short period:
83 companies expressed interest to join the program;
73 Companies have enrolled as official members;
This is for advanced training of business executives especially from Indian SMEs.
The program has resulted in:
increased investments, creation of new joint ventures and increased B2B contacts between the two countries
Over 500 Indian managers have benefited by this programme so far.
In addition, there is a good weather already existing.
Mercedes Benz India inaugurated its second manufacturing facility in Chakan in July 2015.
This will double the plant capacity to 20,000 units per annum.
For our efforts, we have also received good global recognition.
I would like to mention some of them.
India remains a bright spot in the subdued economic landscape across the world;
India has emerged as the fastest growing major economy the last three years with GDP growth rate of over 7%;
We have moved up 32 places in last two years in the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum- this is highest for any country;
India also moved up 19 places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of World Bank;
We have also moved up 16 places on the Global Innovation Index of WIPO in 2016.
We are 3rd among the top 10 FDI destinations listed by UNCTAD;
These are just a few examples.
Our emphasis has been on reducing Govevrnment and enhancing Governance.
I would give some examples:
We are moving fast towards becoming a Digital Economy;
GST is among the most Historic reforms India has ever done- and it is going to be implemented from the next month;
In the last two years, we have moved towards a low tax regime both on personal as well as corporate side;
More than seven thousand reforms have been implemented on the front of Ease of doing business;
36 white industries have been taken out from the requirement of environmental clearance;
Similarly, more than 50 items have been taken out of defence list;
Validity period of industrial licenses has been increased upto fifteen years;
Custom clearance has been made 24X7 at 19 ports and 17 air cargo complexes;
Incorporating a company along with allotment of DIN, PAN, TAN and the CIN is now just one day affair;
Power connection is provided within a time frame of 15 days;
India’s ranking is now up by 111 places on ‘Getting Electricity’ parameter of World Bank.
The above examples are in addition to thousands of reforms done by the states.
Along with the Federal Government, the states have also taken keen interest in implementing such reforms.
I will give you some examples:
Here, I am mentioning about some states but due to a sense of competition, the trend of reforms is spreading fast to all the states.
Reforms include –
100% implementation of single window system for payments & approvals in 16 states;
100% implementation of e-filing of tax returns in 13 states;
Automated online building plan approval in 13 states;
E-filing system for commercial disputes have been implemented in 11 states;
Specialized Commercial Courts have been established at District level in 13 states;
Now, India has one of the most liberal FDI Policy regimes in the world.
More than 90% of the foreign investment flows are under automatic route.
Hence, nothing is enough when it comes to development.
But we have small timelines.
And this is your opportunity.
We are trying to empower our people to realise this potential through our campaigns like Digital India and Skill India.
To tap the youth energy fully, we have launched the Start up India and Stand up India Campaigns.
Chancellor Merkel and Friends!
I strongly believe that we should create institutional networks to understand and advocate such reforms.
This is necessary to leverage the underlying economic potential of our two countries.
At the end, I invite more and more German colleagues and companies to India.
Our direction, desire and dreams create tremendous business opportunity.
Never before, India was so much ready for business.
We are on a take off stage.
Moreover, our democratic values and an alert judicial system will ensure the safety of your investments.
I assure you that we will work hand in hand with you to make your efforts successful.

Today, on Christmas Day, as a gift the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes.
In a way it is the beginning of two new schemes.
Everybody wants to understand and learn from each other.
To encourage this trend, to strengthen mobile banking and to inculcate the habit of making e-payments, the Government of India is launching from today encouragement schemes for consumers as well as traders.
To encourage customers, the scheme is ‘Lucky Grahak Yojana’ and to encourage traders the scheme is ‘Digi Dhan Vyapaar Yojana’.
Today, on 25th December, as a Christmas gift, fifteen thousand people will get rewards through a draw system, whereby each of the fifteen thousand winners will have one thousand rupees into their accounts and this will be not for today only; starting today this scheme will continue for the next 100 days.
Everyday fifteen thousand people are going to receive rewards of one thousand rupees each.
In the next 100 days, lakhs of families are going to receive crores of rupees as gift, but you will be entitled to this gift only if you make use of mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay Card, UPI, USSD – such means and methods of digital payment.
The draw for rewards will be done based on your use of such digital payment methods.
In addition, there would be a grand draw once every week for such customers in which the prize money will be in lakhs of rupees and three months later on April 14th, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, there would be a mega bumper draw where rewards would be in crores of rupees.
‘Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana’ is mainly for traders and businessmen.
Traders should adopt this scheme themselves and should encourage their customers too in order to make their business cashless.
Such traders will also be rewarded separately and there would be thousands of these rewards.
The traders will run their business activities smoothly and will also have an opportunity to win rewards.
These 300 million people can immediately become part of this rewards scheme.
I have confidence that the countrymen will evince interest in this system and if you enquire from the young people around you, they would surely be aware of these things and on your asking will tell you about these.
Come on, if there is a child studying in 10th or 12th standard in your family, he or she will also be able to teach you well about this.
It is as simple as sending WhatsApp messages on the mobile.
My dear countrymen, I feel delighted to learn that the awareness about how to use technology, making e-payments, making online payments is spreading very fast.
During the past few days, the cashless transactions, or cashless trading has increased by 200 to 300%.
To give cashless trading a big impetus, Government of India has taken a very major decision.
The business community, our traders can well comprehend how momentous this decision is.
Those businessmen who adopt digital transactions, who develop online payment process instead of cash transactions in their trade activities will get Income Tax rebate.
I’ve been told that Assam Government has decided to grant a 10% discount on property tax and business license fee if payments are made through digital transaction.
The branches of Grameen, that is, Rural Banks there getting 75% of their customers to make at least two digital transactions between January and March will get 50 thousands rupees rewards from the government.
I congratulate Assam Government and also all those state governments who have taken such initiatives.
A number of organisations have also successfully carried out many experiments to promote digital transactions amongst the rural folk and poor farmers.
And the interesting fact is that compared to last year the fertilizer sales of GNFC have gone up by 27 percent.
Brothers and sisters, the informal sector occupies a major segment in our economy and in our pattern of life and mostly these people are paid wages for their labour and hard work in cash.
They are paid their salaries in cash and we know that due to this, they are exploited also.
In addition, they are also becoming entitled to the other benefits due to them.
Our country is blessed with the maximum number of young people.
Our youth have benefitted quite a lot from ‘Start-Ups’.
But we must also connect with the drive to rid the country of black money and corruption with all our might.
I am thankful to the countrymen for helping me by writing these innumerable letters to me.
Shriman Gurumani Kewal has written on MyGov – “This step of reigning in black money is praiseworthy.
We citizens are facing some difficulties, but we are all fighting against corruption and we are happy that we are making a contribution in this fight.
We are battling corruption, black money etc on the lines of Military Forces.”
When the people face problems, undergo hardships, rare will be a fellow human being who will not empathise.
I feel as much pain as you do.
But I have seen that despite rampant rumour mongering, citizens have stood firm with their faith intact.
I salute this great ability of the people also from the core of my heart.
The people represent the will of the Almighty and their blessings become His blessings.
I thank the people of this country and salute them for participating in this Mahayagya against black money and corruption with utmost zeal.
It was my earnest wish that the ongoing campaign against corruption and black money, including the realm of political parties and political funding, be discussed extensively in the Parliament.
Had the House functioned properly, there would have been comprehensive deliberation.
People, who cannot endorse corruption and black money openly, resort to searching for faults of the government relentlessly.
This government is for the sake of the people.
The secret is that my sources of such information are people themselves.
Information being received from common citizens is many times higher than that being obtained through government machinery.
And we are by and large being successful in our operations on account of the awareness and alertness that the people have displayed.
Can anyone imagine the level of risk, which the aware citizen of my country is taking to expose such elements!
The information received has largely proved to be fruitful.
The government is committed to fight all such wrongdoings and maladies.
And when we have your active support, this fight becomes much easier.
Thirdly, there is another group of letter writers, also existing in large numbers.
They say – Modiji, do not feel exhausted, do not stop and take the most stringent measures that you can.
Now that you have chosen this path, the journey should culminate at its intended and logical destination.
I specially thank writers of such letters, since their writing exudes a certain confidence, fortified with blessings.
It just lay dormant gathering dust.
We have retrieved it and turned it into an incisive law against ‘Benami Property’.
In the coming days, this law will also become operational.
For the benefit of the Nation, for the benefit of the people, whatever needs to be done will be accorded our top priority.
My dear countrymen, I had mentioned in last month’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ that even amidst these hardships our farmers toiled tirelessly and broke last year’s record in sowing.
It is a sign of good times for the agricultural sector.
The diligent hard work by this country’s workers, and farmers, and youth has scripted a new chapter of success with flying colours.
Recently India proudly inscribed her name in various sectors of the global economic scenario.
It is solely on account of the tireless exertions of our countrymen that on myriad indicators, India has charted an upward trajectory in global rankings.
India’s ranking has gone up in the Doing Business Report of the World Bank.
In the Global Competitive Report of the World Economic Forum, India has made a big leap upwards by 32 ranks.
There are many reports whose evaluation indicate that India is taking rapid strides ahead.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of Parliament became the object of ire of our countrymen.
Indignation was expressed everywhere about the activities in the Parliament.
The President and Vice President also explicitly expressed their displeasure.
But even in such a situation, sometimes good things also take place which create a sense of satisfaction in the mind.
Amid the din in Parliament, an excellent task was accomplished, which has not attracted due attention of the country.
Brothers and sisters, today with pride and joy I would like to mention that a bill in connection with my government’s mission on Divyangjan, that is, differently or specially abled people was passed in Parliament.
My intention was to ensure that the Divyangjan secure their due rights and also the honour and dignity that they are entitled to.
Our efforts and our trust were fortified by our Divyaang brothers and sisters when they returned with 4 medals from the Paralympics.
With their triumph, not only did they do the Nation proud, they pleasantly surprised many people through their capabilities and prowess.
Our Divyaang brothers and sisters are an invaluable heritage, a precious endowment, just as every citizen of the country is.
Today I am immensely delighted that the passing of this Law for the welfare of the Divyaangjan will open up additional avenues of employment for them.
In government jobs, the extent of reservation for them has been enhanced to 4%.
Special provisions have been provided for in this Law for their education, facilities and also for grievances.
The extent of sensitivity of the government towards the Divyaangs can be assessed by the fact that during the last two years, the central government set up 4350 camps for Divyaangs, spent 352 crore rupees for distributing implements to 5,80,000 Divyaang brothers and sisters.
The government has passed the new law in consonance with the spirit expressed by the United Nations.
Many such new categories of Divyaangs have been included thereby providing them for the first time justice and opportunities.
For example, categories like Thalassemia, Parkinson’s, or for that matter Dwarfism have been included.
My young friends, during the last few weeks, news items coming in from the world of sports have made all of us proud.
Being Indians, it is but natural for us to feel elated.
In the cricket series against England, India has triumphed 4-0.
In this, the performance of some of the younger players deserves a special word of praise.
The young Karun Nair scored a triple century and K. L. Rahul played a brilliant 199 run innings.
Test captain Virat Kohli batted extremely well and also provided inspiring leadership.
Indian Cricket team’s off-spin bowler R. Ashwin has been declared ‘Cricketer of the Year’ as well as ‘Best Test Cricketer’ by the ICC for the year 2016.
My heartiest congratulations and many good wishes go to all of them.
After a gap of 15 years, there was good news, in fact grand news from the hockey arena too.

Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam, a voice of influence in the world of finance,Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of Monetary Authority of Singapore, a leading institution in fintech,Tens of thousands of participants from over one hundred countries,
It is a great honour to be the first Head of Government to deliver the keynote address at Singapore Fintech Festival.
This is a tribute to the youth of India with its eyes firmly fixed to the future.
It is an acknowledgement of the financial revolution sweeping through India and transforming the lives of 1.3 billion people.
This is an event of finance and technology and, it is also a festival.
This is the season of the Indian Festival of Lights – Deepawali.
It is celebrated all over the world as a victory of virtue, hope, knowledge and prosperity.
The Diwali lights are still on in Singapore.
The Fintech Festival is also a celebration of belief.
And, it is no surprise that in just its third year, this Festival is already the world’s largest.
Singapore has been a global hub for finance and, it is now taking a leap into the digital future of finance.
I have heard of an advice going around in start-up circles.
● To increase your Venture Capital or VC funding by 10 percent, tell the investors you run a “platform”, not a regular business.
● If you want to increase your VC funding by 20 percent, tell the investors that you are operating in the “fintech space”.
● But, if you really want the investors to empty their pockets, tell them that you are using “blockchain” .
It tells you of the excitement and promise of emerging technologies to transform the world of finance.
Indeed, history has shown that finance is often the first to embrace new technology and connectivity.
We are in an age of a historic transition brought about by technology.
From desktop to cloud, from internet to social media, from IT Services to Internet of Things,we have come a long way in a short time.
There is daily disruption in businesses.
The character of the global economy is changing.
Technology is defining competitiveness and power in the new world.
And, it is creating boundless opportunities to transform lives.
I had said at the United Nations in 2014 that we have to believe that development and empowerment can spread with the same speed at which Facebook, Twitter or mobile phones have spread.
Across the world, that vision is rapidly changing into reality.
That mission needed a solid foundation of financial inclusion for all – a task that was not easy in a country of India’s size.
Yet, we wanted to achieve this in months, not years that conventional wisdom suggested.
With the power of fintech and the reach of digital connectivity, we have started a revolution of unprecedented speed and scale.
To begin with financial inclusion has become a reality for 1.3 billion Indians.
We have generated more than 1.2 billion biometric identities – called Aadhaar or foundation – in just a few years.
With our Jan DhanYojana, we aimed to give a bank account to every Indian.
So today, more than a billion biometric identities, more than a billion bank accounts and more than a billion cell phones give India by far the biggest public infrastructure in the world.
More than Rupees 3.6 lakh crore, or 50 billion dollars of benefits from government have reached the people directly.
No longer must a poor citizen in a remote village travel long distances or pay off middle-men to get her rights.
No longer can fake and duplicate accounts bleed government finances.
We have saved over Rupees 80,000 crore, or 12 billion dollars in prevented leakages.
Now, millions who lived on the edge of uncertainty receive insurance in their accounts; and, have access to the security of pension in old age.
A student can get her scholarship directly into her account.
No longer will she be lost in end-less paper chase.
And now, this digital infrastructure has helped launch the world’s largest healthcare scheme this year.
‘Ayushman’ will provide affordable health insurance to 500 million Indians.
It has also helped us extend 145 million loans for small entrepreneurs through Mudra scheme.
In four years, they amount to Rupees 6.5 lakh crore, or 90 billion dollars.
Nearly 75 percent of these loans have gone to women.
Just a few weeks ago, we launched the India Post Payments Bank.
Over 150 thousand post offices across India and 300,000 postal service employees are using technology to provide house to house banking.
Of course financial inclusion also needs digital connectivity.
More than 120,000 village councils in India have already been connected by nearly 300,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables.
Over 300,000 Common Service Centres have brought digital access to villages.
They give our farmers better access to land records, credit, insurance, market and the best price.
They deliver health services and hygiene products to women.
For those with mobile and internet, the BHIM-UPI is the world’s most sophisticated, simpleand seamless platform for payments between accounts, using a virtual payment address.
For those who have a mobile, but no internet, there is U.S.S.D. system in 12 languages.
And, for those who have neither mobile nor internet, there is Aadhar Enabled Payment System, which uses biometrics.
And, it has already registered a billion transactions and grown six-fold in two years.
A shopkeeper can go online to reduce his inventory and speed up collections.
For a fruit grower, a farmer or a rural artisan , the markets are direct and closer, earnings are higher,and payments are faster.
A worker collects wages or remits money home quickly without giving up a day’s work.
Every digital payment saves time.
It adds to a huge national saving.
It is increasing productivity of individuals and our economy.
It also helps improve tax collection and inject fairness in the economy.
Even more, digital payments are a gateway to a world of possibilities.
Financial inclusion also extends to micro, small and medium enterprises.
They are all coming on the nation-wide Goods and Services Tax digital network, launched just over a year ago.
Banks are reaching out to them with credit.
In just a few days, 150,000 such enterprises have come on board for loans.
This is the power of fintech to drive enterprise, employment and prosperity.
Digital technology is introducing transparency and eliminating corruption through innovations such as the Government e-Marketor GEM.
It is an integrated platform for purchases by government agencies.
It has turned India into a leading fintech and Startup nation in the world.
The future of fintech and Industry 4.0 is emerging in India.
They are using Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and machine learning to create solutions for banks, regulators and consumers.
And, they are also embracing our nation’s social missions – from health and education to micro credit and insurance.
This enormous talent pool in India benefits from the ecosystem created by initiatives such as Digital India and Startup India, and by supportive policies, incentives and funding programmes.
It also helps that India has the largest data consumption in the world and the cheapest rates for data.And one of the top nations in fintech adoption.
So, I say this to all the fintech companies and startups – India is your best destination.
The economies of scale achieved in India by the LED bulb industry allowed this energy efficient technology to become more affordable globally.
In short, the Indian story shows six great benefits of fintech: Access ,inclusion; connectivity; ease of living; opportunity; and, accountability.
Across the world, from the Indo-Pacific to Africa to Latin America, we see inspiring stories of extraordinary innovation changing ordinary lives .
But, there is much to be done.
Our focus should be development of all, through , that is, development of the most marginalised.
We must bring the unbanked 1.7 billion people in the world into the formal financial market.
We can use fintech to ensure that no dream remains unfulfilled, and no enterprise remains still born, because of lack of access to finance.
We must make banks and financial institutions more resilient in managing risks,fighting frauds and dealing with disruption of traditional models.
We have to use technology to improve compliance,regulation and supervision, so that innovation flourishes and risks are contained.
We must use fintech tools to combat money laundering and other financial crimes.
The emerging world of finance will succeed in our inter-connected world when our data and systems are trusted and secure.
We have to make our globally wired system safe from cyber threats.
We also need to enhance awareness of the masses and educate them about the opportunities which inclusive policies and use of technology open up for them.
For this,fintech will need to be not merely a mechanism but a movement.
Finally, we must invest in creating skills for the future.
And, be prepared to back ideas and invest for the long term.
to make opportunities and prosperity a reality in a lifetime, for billions.
to make the world more humane and equal –between rich and poor, between cities and villages, between hopes and achievements.
Just as India will learn from others, we will share our experience and expertise with the world.
Because,what drives India also holds hope for others.
And,what we dream for India is what we also wish for the world.
This is a common journey for all.
Abhishek says he was inspired by the Prime Minister`s call for Swachh Bharat, to undertake such a journey to motivate people towards this cause.
He says he will devote an entire year to the cause of Swachh Bharat.
The Prime Minister complimented Abhishek for his unique effort, and wished him well for his future endeavours.
Bilateral relations between India and Russia are marked by broad understanding on issues of mutual interest.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-ln) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the US Homeland Security Department on cooperation in the field of Cyber Security.
The MOU was signed on 11th January 2017 in New Delhi.
He laid the foundation stone for IIT Bhilai.
He also unveiled a plaque to mark the commencement of phase-2 of BharatNet.
The Prime Minister inaugurated air services between Jagdalpur and Raipur.
He also distributed laptops, certificates and cheques etc. to beneficiaries under various schemes.
Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister asserted that development is the best answer to all kinds of violence.
He said that the Bhilai Steel Plant has contributed in a big way to nation-building.
He said the modernized and expanded plant would be instrumental in building a strong foundation for New India.
He also spoke of the benefits that the other development projects launched today would bring about.
The Prime Minister said that in the last two months, the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan has had a very positive effect.
He spoke of the benefit that schemes such as Jan Dhan Yojana, Mudra Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, Fasal Bima Yojana and Saubhagya have brought about in the State.
Shri Narendra Modi said that keeping in mind the interests of the tribal population, the Forest Rights Act is being strictly implemented.
It has been extremely hot this year.
But it is good that the monsoon is moving ahead on schedule on its natural course.
The weather has become pleasant in several parts of the country with abundant showers.
As a result of the rains, the cool breeze has brought about some respite from the oppressive heat of past few days.
One has seen that no matter how hectic the life is, no matter how tense we are, whether its one’s personal or public life, the arrival of the rains does lift one’s spirits.
The Car festival of Lord Jagannath, the Rath Yatra, is being celebrated in several parts of the country with great piety and fervour.
This festival is now also celebrated in some parts of the world.
In the dictionary, the etymology of the word ‘juggernaut’ traces its roots to the chariot of Lord Jagannath.
And therefore, we can observe that the world has in its own way accepted the significance of the Car Festival of Lord Jagannath, The Rath Yatra.
On the occasion of Lord Jagannath’s Car Festival, I extend my heartiest greetings to all my fellow countrymen, and offer my obeisance to Lord Jagannath.
India’s diversity is its unique characteristic, and India’s diversity is also its strength.
The holy month of Ramzan is observed all across, in prayer with piety.
And now the festival of Eid is here.
On the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, my heartiest greetings to one and all.
Let us come together and take inspiration from these holy festivals and share their joyous treasures, and take the nation forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, I came across a very inspiring incident at Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
During this Ramzan the villagers decided to get together and construct toilets.
Now, to construct these household toilets, the government gives financial assistance, under which, they were provided a sum of 17 lakh rupees.
I felicitate the residents of Mubarakpur, for transforming the pious occasion of Ramzan into an opportunity for the welfare of society on.
Each and everything about them is inspiring.
And the most important of it all is that they have freed Mubarakpur of the scourge of open defecation.
We know that in our country there are three states that have already been declared Open Defecation Free states, that is, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF, this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration, government and especially the people of these five states, for achieving this objective.
We know very well, that tremendous hard work is required to achieve anything worthwhile, whether it is in one’s own life or for the society.
If we have bad handwriting, and we want to improve it, we have to consciously practice for a long time.
Only then will the habit of the body and mind will change.
To free ourselves of these habits we will have to constantly strive and persevere.
Everyone’s attention will have to be drawn.
We will have to repeatedly remind ourselves of good inspirational incidents.
And I’m happy to see that cleanliness is no longer confined to being a government programme.
It is getting transformed into a movement by the society and the people.
And when government functionaries take this initiative forward with the participation of the masses, it becomes even stronger.
Recently I came across a wonderful incident, which I would like to share with you.
This happened in the Vizianagaram District of Andhra Pradesh.
The district administration there undertook a huge task with people’s participation.
And my Dear Countrymen, you will be happy to learn that the administration and the people together did construct 10,000 toilets in hundred hours successfully.
One needs to be constantly alert about our Democracy, that is why we must also keep remembering the events that inflicted harm upon our democracy; and at the same time move ahead, carrying forward the virtues of democracy.
The country had virtually become a prison.
The voice of the opposition had been smothered.
Several prominent leaders including Jai Prakash Narayan had been jailed.
The judicial system too could not escape the sinister shadows of the Emergency.
The press was completely muffled.
We have to further fortify that legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian today, is proud and holds his head high.
21st June 2017 – Yoga has permeated the entire world.
From the seashores to the mountains, people welcomed the first rays of the sun, with Yoga.
Which Indian wouldn’t be proud of this!
It isn’t as if Yoga didn’t exist before, but now the threads of Yoga have bound everyone together, and have become the means to unite the world.
Almost all the countries in the world made Yoga Day their own.
In China, Yoga was practiced on the Great Wall of China, and on the World Heritage site of Machu Picchu in Peru, at 2400 metres above sea level.
In France, yoga was performed in the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower.
In Abu Dhabi in UAE, more than 4000 persons participated in mass yoga.
In Herat, in Afghanistan, on the India Afghan Friendship Dam, Salma Dam, Yoga added a new aspect to India’s friendship.
In a small country like Singapore, programs were organised in 70 places, with a week long campaign.
On the occasion of International Day of Yoga, the UN released ten stamps.
A ‘Yoga Session with Yoga Masters’ was organised at the UN headquarters.
The staff of the UN and diplomats from across the world participated.
Yoga has created a world record again this time also.
In Ahmedabad in Gujarat, around 55 thousand people performed Yoga together and created a new world record.
I too had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga event held in Lucknow.
But I also had the good fortune to practice Yoga in the rain for the first time.
Our soldiers practiced yoga in Siachen where temperatures reach minus 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Whether it is our armed forces, or the BSF, ITBP, CRPF and CISF, each one of them, apart from their duties has made Yoga a part of their lives.
On this Yoga Day, since this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had asked you to share photos of three generations of the family doing yoga together.
Some TV channels also took this idea forward.
I received a lot of photographs out of which, selected photographs are compiled and uploaded on the NarendraModiApp.
So, can we do something about it?
Is there nothing we can do to have this implemented throughout the country, Sir?”
Recently, I had the opportunity to go to one of my favorite events.
A very good programme is being run in Kerala for the past few years, by the P.N. Panicker Foundation, which encourages people to cultivate the habit of reading books and to enhance their awareness towards this, by organising celebrations such as ‘Reading Day’, and ‘Reading Month’.
And that too, a ‘Khadi’ handkerchief, so that it promotes ‘Khadi’.
Till the time I was in Gujarat, this habit had been ingrained in us, but after coming here, I had lost that habit.
When I went to Kerala, it was rekindled.
I have already begun to issue instructions in the government.
Here too we can gradually nurture this habit.
You receive it in your hand for a moment and then abandon it.
But when you present a book, it becomes a part of the household, a part of the family.
One can also use a ‘Khadi’ handkerchief to welcome people, and be a support to the innumerable underprivileged.
I say this, thinking of the historical value of such gifts.
The atmosphere was imbued with maternal warmth, and I was served with great affection.
So many years have passed and yet, Queen Elizabeth has treasured the handkerchief gifted by Mahatma Gandhi.
And she was happy to show it to me, when I went there.
As I gazed at it, the Queen encouraged me to touch it.
A small gift by Mahatma Gandhi, has become a part of her life and a part of history.
I know that these habits do not change overnight, and when we talk about it, we invite criticism.
Despite that, one should keep talking about it, and keep making the effort.
Now, I cannot say that if I go somewhere and somebody brings a bouquet I will refuse it.
No, I won’t do that, but we will talk about it even though there is criticism, and then gradually, the change will happen.
My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are numerous tasks to be handled.
She got some money from the bank, under the ‘Mudra’ Scheme and commenced working towards procuring some items from the market for sale.
Then she came to know of the ‘Government E-Marketplace’ system initiated by the government.
She tried to find out the details, and asked people about it.
Whoever wants to supply any item to the government, small things such as electric bulbs, dustbins, brooms, chairs and tables, they can register themselves.
So, when people register in E-GEM, all the government departments become aware of them.
As there are no middlemen, the goods are available at very reasonable rates.
She wrote that the PMO had ordered two thermoses, and she was paid Rupees 1600/-.
This is empowerment.
This has transparency, this has empowerment, this has entrepreneurship too.
I would certainly like that whoever wishes to sell their products or business items to the government, should increasingly get connected with this website.
I believe that this is an excellent example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance, and it’s objective is Minimum Price and Maximum Ease, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we take pride in Yoga, on the other we can also take pride in our achievements in space science.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Nano satellites with the ‘Cartosat-2 Series Satellite.’
And besides India, these satellites are of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America, nearly 14 such countries.
And with India’s Nano Satellite Mission, we will get a lot of help in the field of agriculture, farming, and dealing with natural disasters.
We are all aware that a few days ago, ISRO has successfully launched the GSAT-19.
And of all the satellites launched by India, this was the heaviest satellite.
The newspapers of our country have compared it with elephantine weights.
You can well imagine the magnitude of the achievement of our scientists in space.
On the 19th of June, our Mars Mission completed one thousand days.
You may be aware that when we had successfully created a place for the Mars Mission in orbit, this entire mission was planned for a duration of 6 months.
It had a life expectancy of 6 months.
The completion of one thousand days, is an important milestone in our scientific journey, our space odyssey.
These days we see that our youth are getting increasingly inclined to the field of sports.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to him and his coach for this victory.
I had the opportunity, a few days ago to be associated with the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of the renowned athlete, P.T. Usha’s Usha School of Athletics.
The more we promote sports, the more we see the spirit of sportsmanship.
Sports play an important role in personality development also.
There is a great significance of sports in overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in our country.
If the children in our family are interested in sports, they should be given opportunities.
They should not be forced off the playing fields to be locked in rooms with books.
They should study as well, if they can do well in studies, they should certainly do so, but if they have the potential and the inclination to do well in sports, that should be encouraged and supported by the school, college, family and all the people around them.
Each one should nurture dreams for the next Olympics.

“Today, Jan Dhan Yojana completes 3 years.
I congratulate the crores of people, particularly the poor, who benefitted from this initiative.
Jan Dhan Revolution is a historic movement to bring the poor, downtrodden and marginalised into the financial mainstream.
Through Jan Dhan Yojana, social security schemes, MUDRA & Stand-Up India, we have given wings to millions of aspirations.

Sad to hear of his demise.
Rest in Peace”, the Prime Minister said.
He said every citizen should prepare a roadmap towards it.
Your Excellency President U Htin Kyaw, Members of the media,
Myanmar is special for us.
It holds a unique position in India’s neighbourhood.
It is a land bridge that connects India with South East Asia.
The longstandingcultural and historical linkages between our societies form a solid foundation of our ties.
Buddhist principles of metta or loving kindness and Sarva Pantha Sambhava equality of all religions define our ways of life.
Your great nation has entered a new era.
An era defined by maturity of your leadership and commitment of your people to democracy.
And, which is accompanied by a clear vision and a strong desire of your leadership to make Myanmar a stable, and economically prosperous country in the region.
As the new government of Myanmar starts its journey to:
• Build new institutions and strengthen existing ones;
• Seek a firm path to economic prosperity; and above all
• Pursue an ambition to build a modern nation;
President and I have just concluded useful discussions on the whole range of our bilateral engagement.
We recognised that our security interestsare closely aligned.
And, we agreed on the need to remain sensitive to each other’s strategic interests and concerns.
To this end, President and I agreed to work together for the safety and security of our people.
And, actively cooperate to combat the common challenges of terrorism and insurgent activity in our region.
I have also conveyed India’s full support to the peace process initiative under the ‘21st Century Panglong Conference.
Its extent and depth is shaped by a robust development cooperation partnership, which has a strong “people first” philosophy.
India’s nearly 2 billion dollar development assistance is touching the lives of the common man of Myanmar.
Our engagement is supporting projects in connectivity, infrastructure, capacity building education, healthcare and many other sectors.
Some concrete examples of our partnership include:
• Kaladan project, with its port and waterway segment nearing completion later this year;
• India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway;
• Myanmar Institute of Information Technology;
• Advanced Centre of Agricultural Research and Education; as well as
• Smaller projects in health, education and industrial training sector.
The two operational agreements signed today will facilitate the construction and upgrading of 69 bridges and the Kalewa-Yargi road section of the Trilateral Highway Project.
We are also determined to deepen our cooperation in agriculture, banking, power, and energy.
The MoUs on Cooperation in Renewable Energy and on Traditional Systems of medicine will operationalize our cooperation in these areas.
We have also agreed to work towards a long-term and a mutually beneficial arrangement for trade in pulses.
In April this year, we took the small step of supplying power to Tamu in Myanmar.
I have told the President that we are willing to substantially scale up our supply of power.
India stands ready to enhance our development partnership with Myanmar.
And, do so as per the priorities of the Myanmar Government.
Culture is a key centrality in the foundation of our ties.
I am happy that our partnership is restoring Ananda temple in Bagan in Myanmar.
We are also ready to restore other historic monuments and pagodas, which were damaged in the earthquake which hit Myanmar just last week.
And, our discussions today have enabled us to evolve a road map and an action agenda for our cooperation.
I look forward to working with you to take the relationship to new heights.
A bright future for Myanmar is not just your objective.
It is also our aspiration.
Once again, Excellency, a very warm welcome to India.

I am delighted to visit this great country once again.
It is indeed a great pleasure to see so many familiar faces here.
I thank CII and Keidanren for creating this opportunity.
I have always considered my engagements with you extremely useful.
Over the years, I have visited Japan several times.
Indeed, my personal engagement with the leadership, Government, Industry and people of Japan is now almost a decade old.
The very word “Japan” in India is a benchmark of quality, excellence, honesty and integrity.
Japanese people have led the world in sustainable development.
There is also a deep sense of social responsibility and ethical behaviour.
We are also familiar with Japan’s enormous contributions to the process of development in other parts of the world, especially in Asia and Africa.
India’s core values are rooted in our civilizational heritage.
It gets inspiration through the teachings of Truth from Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi.
It gets its wings from our democratic traditions, emphasis on both wealth and value creation, a robust sense of enterprise and quest to modernize and prosper its economy.
That is why India and Japan are best suited to work together.
Our past has desired us to stand together.
Our present is encouraging us to work together.
I have been saying that this twenty first (21st Century) is Asia’s Century.
Asia has emerged as the new centre of global growth.
Today, India is on the path of several major transformations.
We have taken decisive steps and built a governance system that will help India realize its potential.
The results are already visible.
Even against a weak international economic scenario, the news from India is of strong growth and abundant opportunities.
It is of Incredible opportunities, and about India’s Credible Policies.
In 2015, the Indian economy grew faster than other major economies.
World Bank and IMF assess this trend to continue.
Lower labour costs, large domestic market and macro-economic stability combine to make India a very attractive investment destination.
In the last two fiscal years, we received about 55 billion dollars as foreign direct investment.
This is not only highest ever FDI but also highest growth in FDI in India.
Today, every global company has an India strategy.
And, Japanese companies are no exception.
It is no surprise that today Japan is India’s fourth largest source of FDI.
Japanese investments extend to both green-field and brown-field projects; manufacturing and services; infrastructure and insurance; and e-commerce and equity.
On our part, we would, of course, want greater influx of Japanese investments.
For this, we will be proactive in addressing your concerns.
And, we will further strengthen the special mechanisms including Japanese Industrial Townships.
I encourage you to make use of the ten-year business visa, the e-Tourist Visa, and the Visa-On-Arrival facility that we now offer to Japanese travellers.
India’s development needs are huge and substantial.
All of these offer unprecedented opportunities for Japanese industry.
Made in India and Made by Japan combination has already started to work and converge wonderfully.
Cars made in India by a Japanese car maker are already selling in Japan.
I wish to thank and congratulate those of you who are already in India.
To those who are exploring, I promise you that we are committed to further refine our policies and procedures to boost Make in India.
Creating an enabling environment for business and attracting investments remains my top priority.
Stable, predictable and transparent regulations are redefining the nature of doing business in India.
E-governance is no longer just a fancy buzzword, but a basic facility.
We have successfully enacted a new legislation regarding Goods and Services Tax (GST).
The Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code passed recently will make it easier for investors to have an exit.
We are setting up commercial courts and commercial divisions to ensure speedy disposal of commercial matters.
The arbitration proceedings will now become faster as the Arbitration law has been amended.
In June this year, we have further relaxed our FDI regime.
We have also announced a new Intellectual Property Rights policy.
All of these point to the new direction of economic reforms that India is pursuing.
My resolve is to make India the most open economy in the world.
The impact of our efforts is being felt and recognized globally.
· FDI equity inflows have gone up by 52% in last two years.
· India has gone up 19 spots on the World Logistics Performance Index 2016 brought out by the World Bank.
· We have done substantial improvement on Ease of doing business.
Our ranking has improved considerably.
I have long maintained that India needs scale, speed and skill.
Japan has a very important role to play in all three.
Its involvement in our mega projects like Dedicated Freight Corridors, Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor, Metro Rail and High Speed Rail signifies scale and speed.
The captains of Japanese business and industry sitting here will agree with me that a combination of Japan’s technologies and India’s human resources will create a win-win situation.
I have said earlier also that the combination of your hardware and our software is a fantastic combination.
It will benefit both countries.
Let us join hands even more closely and strongly.
Let us march forward and explore bigger potentials and brighter prospects.
India, today took another major step in the fight against tax evasion, “round tripping” and “base erosion/profit shifting”.
I am happy to be with you on my first visit to Kenya as Prime Minister.
Indians in general, and Gujaratis in particular, have had their second home in Kenya.
So, from that perspective, I am really late in visiting this great country.
There has been a long gap of nearly 35 years for the visit of Indian Prime Minister.
Though at a personal level, I was able to maintain engagements with Kenya.
As Chief Minister of Gujarat, I visited Kenya in 2008.
We also received delegations in Gujarat from here.
Kenya’s economy and its infrastructure make it an influential player in the region.
You are the only developing country which hosts the headquarters of UN agencies.
India and Kenya have had a very special relationship.
Mr. President, I am aware that your government has laid great emphasis on the use of solar energy in daily life.
We are also working on an ambitious renewable energy programme.
India and Kenya are blessed by sufficient solar radiation.
Solar energy is a real solution for global warming.
It is also a good strategy for providing electricity to remote villages and hamlets.
We look forward to work together on this front under the International Solar Alliance.
Similarly, health sector is another area of great interest to both sides.
We are happy that thousands of Kenyan patients have returned from India after a successful treatment.
I understand that Kenya would like to replicate the Indian experience in Medicare and become a medical hub in the region.
We would be happy to support you in this process.
These are just a few indicators of the depth of our relationship and the potentials for co-operation.
We can do a lot together to nurture and train this human capital which can serve the whole world.
Today, India is the fastest growing large economy of the world.
We are not only having a high growth rate; we are also going up in various global indicators.
India has changed a lot in last two years.
We are now the most preferred destination for FDI.
In the year of 2015, we have received highest ever FDI.
And for you the good news is that India is the largest trading partner of Kenya.
India is also the second largest investor here.
We will be happy to further remove the imbalance in trade between us.
We will also be happy to enhance the level of investment in Kenya.
I am here to assure the people and Government of Kenya that India stands by you.
Our friendship is only a win-win game.
Whether it is Kenyan students in India; or Indian professionals in Kenya- both should shine.
Whether it is mines, minerals or machines; all are rewarding areas.
We should jointly explore the opportunities.
Various initiatives during my visit including this meeting are indicators in that direction.
I assure Kenya that India will always work to strengthen your processes and enrich your resources.
It is my pleasure to present the book to His Excellency the President of Kenya.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has paid tributes to Babu Jagjivan Ram on his death anniversary.
“I bow to the great Babu Jagjivan Ram ji on his Punya Tithi.
Thank you, Excellency, for your warm words of welcome.
And, for the exceptional generosity with your time and friendship.
I will truly cherish the most wonderful dinner that you and Mrs Netanyahu hosted for me yesterday.
Our conversation last night, meeting Mrs Netanyahu, learning about your family especially what you told me about your father has taken my experience of your beautiful country to a whole new level.
India admires the success of your people in overcoming adversity to advance, innovate and flourish against all odds.
I am honoured to be in Israel on this extra-ordinary visit.
In our modern journey, our paths have been different, but our belief in democratic values and economic progress has been a shared pursuit.
This visit is an occasion:
• to rejuvenate the bonds of our friendship;
• to compose a new chapter in our ties; and
• to jointly venture towards new horizons of engagement.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have had productive discussions covering an extensive menu of issues.
Not just on areas of bilateral opportunities.
But, also how our cooperation can help the cause of global peace and stability.
Our goal is to build a relationship that reflects our shared priorities and draws on enduring bonds between our peoples.
Israel is among the leading nations in the field of innovation, water and agricultural technology.
These are also among my priority areas in India’s development.
We agreed that efficiency of water and resource use; water conservation and its purification; productivity increases in agriculture are key areas in deepening our bilateral cooperation.
We are of one view that together our scientists and researchers would develop, build and implement mutually beneficial solutions in the field.
Our decision to establish a bilateral Technology Innovation Fund worth US$ 40 million for research in industrial development will help us in achieving this goal.
We regard thriving two-way trade and investment flows as the bedrock of a strong partnership.
This would also be our message to the CEO Forum tomorrow.
India and Israel live in complex geographies.
We are aware of strategic threats to regional peace and stability.
India has suffered firsthand the violence and hatred spread by terror.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I agreed to do much more together to protect our strategic interests and also cooperate to combat growing radicalization and terrorism, including in cyber space.
This is the final resting place for forty-four of the Indian soldiers who sacrificed their lives during World War 1 to liberate that city.
Tomorrow, I will travel to Haifa to pay homage to our brave Indian soldiers.
Excellency Netanyahu,
Let me also take this chance to invite you and Mrs. Netanyahu and your family to visit India.
I again thank you for your warm welcome and hospitality.
Thank you very much.
Visit to Tesla Motors.

Your Excellency, President Magufuli,
Distinguished guests,
Despite today being a Sunday, you have taken out time for us.
For this, I am grateful to you.
This is the spirit with which I have come to Tanzania today.
The ties between our two countries have deep historical roots.
For over centuries, our people have known each other.
The waters of Indian Ocean connect us.
And, we are two nations with strong maritime traditions.
For centuries, we have harnessed the favourable winds to trade across waters of Indian Ocean.
We talk of an inter-dependent world today.
Way back in the eighteenth century, the Mandvi port of Gujarat and Zanzibar were considered inter-dependent ports.
Literature talks of merchants in Mandvi port in Gujarat eagerly awaiting the arrival of Swahili boats.”
Most early Indian migrants to your great country happened to be from my home state.
Today, the Indian origin community in Tanzania is an important link between our people in the fields of business, healthcare, and education.
In recent decades, right from the times of President Nyerere, our shared values, common struggles, and a strong desire for the progress and prosperity of our peoples has defined our ties.
In recent years, our ties of commerce, links of trade and investments, and development cooperation have flourished.
My detailed discussions with President Magufuli today covered the full range of our partnership.
Our comprehensive agenda of cooperation is driven by our key development priorities and our common security needs.
These discussions would lay the foundation on which we will construct a twenty first century partnership.
• expand your education and health care system; and
• industrialize your economy;
• skill your youth;
• build your capacities and institutions;
• secure your people and society.
You will find in India a reliable friend.
And as a friend, we are ready and willing to share our experiences, our expertise, our capacities and our technology with Tanzania.
And, do so based on your needs and priorities.
I request you to join me in raising a toast:
• To the health and success of His Excellency, President John Magufuli;
• To the progress and prosperity of the friendly and hospitable people of this great country, the United Republic of Tanzania; and
Your Excellency, President Johann Schneider-Ammann,
Thank you, Excellency, for your warm remarks and generous welcome.
India and Switzerland have both been the voices of peace, understanding and humanitarian values in the world.
In last seven decades, our friendship has consistently seen an upward trajectory.
Today, President and I reviewed our multifaceted bilateral ties.
We also held detailed discussions with Swiss CEOs.
Ties of collaboration in trade, investment, science and technology and skill development benefit both our societies.
India has affirmed it’s readiness to resume FTA talks with EFTA.
We are all aware of the strengths of the Swiss economy.
But, India too is undergoing profound transformations.
We are today the fastest growing economy in the world.
But, that alone is not enough.
I want the Indian economy to be driven by smart and sustainable cities, robust farm sector, vibrant manufacturing and dynamic service sector.
And, its engines to run on world class network of rail, roads, airports and digital connectivity.
Where a home for everyone, and electricity in every home is a reality.
And, its 500 million plus youth is skilled and ready to meet the global needs of manpower.
In tune with its objectives and India’s civilizational ethos an economically prosperous India will also be friendly to the planet and our environment.
Reliance on renewable energy, rather than on fossil fuels would be our guiding motto.
We see a perfect connect between our development needs and Swiss strengths.
I, therefore, invite the Swiss companies to avail of this great opportunity to be a key partner in India’s economic growth.
Ultimately, the economic prosperity of 1.25 billion plus would also benefit the entire world.
India and Switzerland also share a commitment to reform international institutions in line with current global realities.
We have both agreed to support each other for our respective bids for the non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
I am also thankful to the President for Switzerland’s understanding and support for India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
Combating the menace of “black money” and tax evasion is also our shared priority.
We discussed the need for an early and expeditious exchange of information to bring to justice the tax offenders.
An early start to negotiations on the Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information would be important in this respect.
Strong ties between the people of our two countries are an important base and benchmark of our linkages.
Thanks to the Indian film industry, we are very familiar with the enchanting beauty of the Swiss landscapes.
There are many success stories of our relationship.
One that has been making waves in the Grand Slams of the tennis world is the partnership of famous Swiss player Martina Hingis with Sania Mirza and Leander Paes of India.
I am confident that our common commitments and values, people to people links and a strong and growing economic partnership will take our relations to new heights.
I thank you, Excellency, once again for hosting me in Geneva.

We will discuss our respective visions and priorities for national development, particularly in the context of current and future international situation.
My fellow citizens, my namaskar to all of you!
26th January, our Republic Day was celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in every nook and corner of the nation by all of us.
I hope that the amount of emphasis that is given to the rights at every level during most of the time, is also given to discussing duties of citizens in an emphatic manner.
The rights and duties of the citizens constitute the railway track, on which the train of democracy in India can move ahead at a fast pace.
Tomorrow is 30th January, the death anniversary of our revered Bapu.
All of us pay tributes to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the motherland, by observing silence for 2 minutes at 11 am on 30th January.
As a society, as a nation, the 2 minute tribute of silence on 30th January at 11 am, should become our instinctive nature.
This 2 minutes silence is an expression of our collective resolve and reverence for the martyrs.
In our country there is an innate respect for the military and the security forces.
I congratulate and felicitate the young heroes and their families who were honoured with various gallantry awards on the eve of this Republic Day.
There are various categories of these gallantry awards like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Vishisht Seva Medal and Param Vishisht Seva Medal.
I want to urge the youth especially that since you are very active on social media, you can do one thing.
Surf the Net to do some research on the valiant bravehearts, who have been bestowed with these honours, compose a few good lines about them and share these with your friends and companions.
When we get to know the in depth details of their courage, bravery, valour in detail, we are filled with astonishment and pride and we also get inspired!
While we were all delighted with the tidings of enthusiasm and celebration of 26th January, at the same time, some of our army Jawans posted in Kashmir for the defense of the country, achieved martyrdom due to the avalanche.
I respectfully pay my homage to all these brave soldiers, I bow to them.
My young friends, you know very well that I regularly do my ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
January, February, March, April – all these are for every family, months of most severe test!
Troubled families, harassed students, tense teachers – one sees a very strange psychological atmosphere prevailing in each home!
And I have always felt that we should come out of this situation and, therefore, today I want to talk in some detail with my young friends.
I received a telephonic message from Srishti.
You too listen to what Srishti has to say: –
“Sir, I want to tell you that during exam time, very often in our homes, in the neighbourhood and in our society, a very terrifying and scary atmosphere pervades.
This leads to a situation, where the students instead of feeling inspired feel tremendously down.
So I just want to ask you this, can’t this be transformed into a pleasant atmosphere?”
Well, the question has been posed by Srishti, but it is a question that must be there in the minds of all of you.
Exams in themselves, should be a joyous occasion.
After a year of hard work, one has the opportunity to display one’s capabilities, so this should be a festival of joy and enthusiasm.
And when there is a festive mood of celebration, the best within us comes out.
The true realisation of the strength of a society also takes place during festivals.
The best of everything finds a manifestation.
And you will see for yourself, that the pressure will be converted into pleasure.
The festive atmosphere will lead to a burden-free environment.
And I especially urge the parents to create a festive atmosphere during these 3-4 months.
All the family members have to work as a team and play with zeal their respective roles to make this festival of examination a success.
You will witness for yourself the ensuing change.
Actually from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup and from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these 3-4 months have examinations galore.
It is the responsibility of each one of us that in our own ways, observing our respective traditions and in tune with our respective family surroundings, we should strive to transform every year these 3-4 months into a festival.
And therefore I shall say to you ‘Smile More Score More’!
The more time these days you will spend being happy, the more will be the number of marks you will earn!
And therefore the most effective medicine that exists for memory recall is relaxation.
And it is by my own personal experience that I’m telling you that if you’re under pressure then you forget even your own things but if you are relaxed, then you can’t even imagine the kind of things you are able to remember, and these become extremely useful.
It is not that you do not have the knowledge, it is not that you do not have the information, and it is not that you have not worked hard!
And therefore it is necessary to remember that ‘a happy mind is the secret for a good mark sheet’!
Sometimes it also appears that we are not able to perceive examinations in a proper perspective.
It seems to become a question of life and death.
See, the exam you are going to appear at is the exam of what you have studied during this whole year.
But it is not a test of your life.
It is not a test of what kind of life have you lived, how is the life you are living now and what is the life you aspire to live.
There must have been many occasions in your life, when, besides the examinations that you appeared at inside the classrooms with notebooks, you had to encounter and endure many tests and trials.
And thus success and failure in life is not determined at all by how one has done at the examination; this is a burden from which you must free yourself.
Now suppose that this failure had caused him to become dejected, to concede defeat in his life, then would India have found such a great scientist and such a glorious President?
Marks have become all important.
As a result, the competition has multiplied leading to a very high increase of stress in the students also.
So I would like to know your views concerning the current direction of education and its future course.”
Although she herself has given the answer to her query, but Richa Ji wishes that I too must put forth my views on the matter.
Life truly goes on in terms of whether whatever you have learned, you have tried to live that also!
Life moves ahead depending upon the condition that whatever the sense of mission you have achieved and whatever is the sense of ambition that you nurture, whether there is any ongoing co-ordination between your sense of mission and your sense of ambition!
If you will have faith in these things, then marks will automatically follow you and you will never have to chase marks!
When you have to fight a big law suit and you go to a lawyer to engage his services, do you look at the mark-sheet of that lawyer?
You only look at his experience, his knowledge, and the graph of his success.
And therefore this burden of hankering for marks hinders us sometimes from going in the right direction.
But this also happens sometimes and if you analyse minutely the journey of your own life, you will realise that if you start running after marks, you will look for the shortest ways, and will identify a few selected things and focus on those only.
But if something comes from outside those few things you had touched upon; a question comes which is outside the bunch of selected questions that you had prepared; you will be find yourself slipping to the rock bottom.
If you have pursuit of knowledge as your focal point, then by itself you try to acquire and attain a lot more.
However if you concentrate and focus only on getting marks, then you gradually go on limiting yourself and confine yourself to certain areas for earning more marks.
Thus, you may find that despite becoming brilliant in passing the exams, you have sometimes failed in life.
Richa Ji had also mentioned about ‘PRATISPARDHA’, meaning ‘competition with others’.
It is a huge psychological battle.
Friends, in every field of life and when taking exams, if you were able to study peacefully for two hours earlier, then are you now able to do so for three hours?
If you couldn’t wake up at the decided time in the morning and were thus delayed, now can you get up early on time?
And when we prevail over ourselves, then the motivation to do better becomes innate, you don’t need any external sources of energy.
If you are better than your competitor, then you will become complacent,as you will be filled with over-confidence.
Therefore I urge you to engage in ‘Anuspardha’, or ‘competition with self’.
You must focus on how to improve upon your past performance and how to perform even better.
And you’ll witness for yourself the positive change that it will bring about in you.
Shriman S. Sunder Ji has expressed his feelings on the role of parents.
He says that during exams, parents have a vital role to play.
He further writes, “My mother was not educated.
Yet, she would sit by me and ask me to solve problems in Mathematics.
She would then compare answers and thus be of great help to me.
My mother did not clear the Class 10 exam, yet without her aid, it would have been impossible for me to pass the CBSE exam.”
Sunder Ji, what you say is absolutely correct.
And you must have observed today also that women are a majority amongst those who ask me questions or send in suggestions.
Acceptance brings about new avenues in finding solutions to problems.
Expectations make the path difficult.
Accepting a certain state provides us with the opportunity of opening up newer vistas.
Once, many years ago, one of our acquaintances was admitted to a hospital, following a heart attack.
He started cracking jokes and lightened the atmosphere in a matter of just a few minutes.
Have you ever thought of creating an atmosphere of joy and laughter for children during exams?
See it for yourself, the whole ambience will be transformed.
I have received an incredible phone call.
The gentleman does not wish to reveal his name.
When you listen to the call, you will come to know why he does not want to identify himself!
“Namaskar, Pradhan Mantriji, I cannot divulge my name because of something that I did in my childhood.
I could have very well secured the same marks by devoting that time to studying, which I wasted while pondering how to copy.
Moreover, when I tried to use unfair means to pass the exam, I got caught and a lot of my friends around me also had to undergo distress because of me.”
What you say is right.
These shortcut ways become the reason for using unfair means.
There are times when not having enough confidence in oneself makes one crave to peep into a fellow student’s answer sheet, may be just to confirm if one has written the correct answer.
Sometimes it happens that our own answer is correct and the other’s answer is wrong.
But we somehow believe that the other’s actually wrong answer is the right one, which leads to our own undoing as well.
Thus unfair means lead us nowhere.
I am reiterating the same, once again.
And once you are habituated to using unfair means, you will never feel the desire to actually learn anything in life.
Where will you reach then?
It is as if you are yourself digging holes in your pathways.
And, I have seen that there are people who squander so much of their talent, invest their entire creativity in finding ingenious ways and means in designing unfair methods.
If one devotes the same time and the same creativity in addressing issues pertaining to exams, one would never require any unfair means in the first place.
Results that you achieve through your own hard work and diligence will invest you with a phenomenal and extra-ordinary self-confidence.
Now listen to this phone call, which I have received: –
During exam days, if I talk about sports and games, your teachers, your parents will be angry with me.
“What kind of a Prime Minister is this, who is asking children to come out and play during exams,” they might say!
People generally nurse the notion that if students indulge in sporting activities, they become careless about their studies.
This notion is basically unfounded.
It is the root cause of this problem.
If someone says, “Let me finish with all exams first, I will play and do other things later”; well, that is impossible.
As a matter of fact, in my opinion, three things are crucial – proper rest, the other is the requisite amount of sleep, the third is the body, which is a major component, way beyond mental activity.
Other parts of the body too require physical activity.
With so much to do, have you ever thought of spending a couple of moments gazing at the sky, looking with wonder at the flora around you, lightening your spirits a bit!
You will notice that you will return to your study room and be amongst your books with a renewed freshness.
Whatever you are doing, take a break, have a stroll outside, enter the kitchen, look for something that you relish to eat, munch on your favourite biscuit if possible, tell or listen jokes and laugh for a while.
I do not know if everyone likes this or not, but I am saying it out of personal experience.
Deep breathing during these times is very beneficial.
He said, “No, but it is linked with your voice problem brought on by delivering so many election speeches.
Only when you get adequate sleep, your vocal chords will be able to rest fully.”
Well, I had never given a thought to a possible connection between my sleep, my speeches and my voice.
It was as if he had given me a herbal panacea.
This is a wonderful remedy for maintaining the vigour of the mind, brain and body.
Anyway, young friends, you are engrossed in preparing for your exams and here I am, engaging you in matters close to my heart.
Of course, it is quite possible that my words this morning will act as a relaxant for you.
In the same breath, I will add that do not let these remarks of mine be a burden on you.
Do it only if you can.
If you cannot do it, please do not do it, else this too will weigh heavily on you.
Just as I advise your parents not to be burdensome to you, the same applies to me too.
Make headway with this Mantra.
My dear countrymen, on 1st February 2017, Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years.
On this occasion I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the officers and jawans of Coast Guard for their service to the Nation.
Our Coast Guard women officers are pilots, work as Observers, and not just that, they command Hovercrafts as well.
It is considered an occasion to worship Vidya, knowledge.
And not just that, it is a celebration of inspiration for brave hearts.
‘Mera Rang de Basanti Chola’ is a perfect example of that.
I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on the pious occasion of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in ‘Mann Ki Baat’, All India Radio too infuses myriad novel hues of creativity and imagination.
Last month onwards, they have started broadcasting versions in regional languages, immediately after the broadcast of my ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
This has gained wide acceptance.
People are writing in from far and wide.
I felicitate All India Radio for this self-inspired initiative from the core of my heart.
‘Mann Ki Baat’ gives me a great opportunity to be connected with you.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the passing away of Selvi J Jayalalithaa.
“Deeply saddened at the passing away of Selvi Jayalalithaa.
Her demise has left a huge void in Indian politics.
Jayalalithaa ji’s connect with citizens, concern for welfare of the poor, the women & marginalized will always be a source of inspiration.
My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Tamil Nadu in this hour of grief.
May the Almighty grant them the strength to bear this irreparable loss with courage and fortitude.
I will always cherish the innumerable occasions when I had the opportunity to interact with Jayalalithaa ji.
A five member delegation from the Aligarh Muslim University, led by Vice Chancellor Lt. Gen. Zameer Uddin Shah, called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today.
I am particularly delighted to be at the Gujarat Forensic Sciences University.
This university and the students studying here are pioneers.
This is not a university that offers courses that are more talked about.
Instead, the focus area is specific.
Your road to Gandhinagar would not have been an easy one.
When you planned to come here, I am sure people asked you are you sure, you want to do this?
Are you watching too many crime related TV shows?
Or, are you reading too many Agatha Christie or Feluda books?
Yet, you persisted and selected a stream that is conventionally believed to be unconventional but highly important for today’s age.
This shows that you not only believe in yourself but also are blessed with the power of determination to pursue your own dreams.
This trait will always help you in the times to come.
Friends, It is a matter of pride that in a short time, GFSU has achieved such a bench-mark of academic excellence that the National Assessment and Accreditation Council has awarded this University an ‘A’ Grade.
I am glad that GFSU is among very few universities in India, to achieve this immediately after establishment.
Friends, criminals and ways of committing crime are constantly changing.
In order to deal with rapidly changing crime scenario, you also have to develop newer techniques to make it clear that criminals will not be spared.
DNA profiling has established new dimensions in forensic investigation.
With the help of this technology, many such cases have been resolved which would otherwise remain unsolved.
Through this bill, we will ensure that all DNA tests remain reliable and the data is safe.
The Government has also decided to strengthen DNA analysis labs in all the States and Union Territories.
A State of the Art lab under the Nirbhaya scheme is being established at Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Chandigarh.
I am confident that in the coming times, we will be able to deter the heinous crimes, including the crimes committed on women, speedily and accurately.
Believe in your potential.
Locard taught you that the perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it.
I am sure you will always be solving crimes.
But, do remember that each one of you students brings great value to our society as well.
And, while adding value, do not forget to also learn from others.
Keep your mind open to new ideas, views and opinions.
Enrich the world with your thoughts and absorb the best that others have to offer.
This diversity is what will make you a richer person.
And, when I say Law of Progressive Change, while your mind would naturally go back to what you were taught, also think about the times to come.
We live in a world that is rapidly changing in every sense.
It does not take much time for a new idea to become old.
Likewise, you too must be at the centre of the changing trends across the globe.
Your education and intelligence has trained you to think out of the box.
Ensure that you use these skills not only to keep pace with the changes around us but also to drive some of the progressive changes that make our world a better place.
Generations to come will thank you for it.
Friends, no scheme or initiative can be successful without the participation of youth.
I am confident that the knowledge you have gained here will help you serve the country effectively and achieve professional success.
I hope you shall continue to hold your Alma Mater in the highest esteem.
I wish all the graduating students a bright and vibrant future.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has expressed deep sympathy towards the affected people, on 5th anniversary of Great East Japan Earthquake.
“On 5th anniversary of Great East Japan Earthquake, India offers deep sympathy to those affected.
Thank you, Excellency, for your kind words.
I am delighted to be here in Nairobi.
In a way, the journey of your life has also been the journey of an Independent Kenya.
It is an honour for me to be with you today.
Kenya is a valued friend and trusted partner of India.
And, today, President and I reviewed all aspects and full range of our relationship.
India is one of the brightest spot in the world economy.
And, Kenya is a land of strong opportunities.
India is Kenya’s largest trading partner, and the second largest investor here.
But, there is potential to achieve much more.
President and I agreed that our economies can benefit more:
This would also enable greater regional economic prosperity.
India and Kenya are two developing countries.
We are also two innovation societies.
The success of M-Pesa is one such classic innovation that has empowered millions the world over.
The multifaceted development partnership is a key pillar of our bilateral relationship.
We look forward to early implementation of the Indian lines of credit for projects in agricultural mechanization, textiles and the development of the small and medium sector.
In this regard, I am happy that the prestigious Kenyatta National Hospital will soon have the state of the art made in India cancer therapy machine – Bhabhatron.
We recognize that without the opportunities for the success of our youth, our societies cannot grow.
For this, we are ready to partner with Kenya in the fields of education, vocational education and skill development.
As such, our closer cooperation in the field of maritime security occupies an important place in our overall defence and security engagement.
The MoU on Defence Cooperation signed just now would strengthen our institutional cooperation between our defence establishments.
This would include greater staff exchanges; sharing of expertise and experiences; training and institution building, cooperation in hydrography, and supply of equipment.
President and I recognize that Terrorism and the rapid spread of radical ideologies pose a common challenge to our people, our countries, to the region and to the whole world.
We have agreed to deepen our security partnership including in the fields of cyber security, combating drugs and narcotics, and human trafficking.
Yesterday, President and I had an unforgettable interaction with the Indian diaspora in Kenya.
As President Uhuru said, they are proud Kenyans even as they cherish their Indian roots.
As we shape deeper contacts between our economies and societies, they form a trusted bond and a strong bridge.
I am also happy to announce that the vibrant Indian culture, which is already a part of Kenya’s rich society, will be showcased in a Festival of India in Kenya later this year.
In the end, let me once again thank you, the Government of Kenya and its people for the warmest of welcomes that I have received.
And, I and the people of India look forward to welcoming you in India.
Thank you very much..
Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Member of the Malaysian Parliament, and Leader of the Parti Keadilan Rakyat Party of Malaysia, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi today.
Mr. Ibrahim was accompanied by two Members of the Malaysian Parliament, Hon. Kesavan Subramanian and Hon. Santhara Kumar Ramanaidu.
The Prime Minister congratulated Mr. Ibrahim on his recent election as President of the PKR Party.
The Prime Minister fondly recalled their last meeting in Malaysia in May 2018.
The Prime Minister also conveyed his warm regards to H. E. Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, Prime Minister of Malaysia.
The Union Cabinet under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to release an instalment of Dearness Allowance (DA) to Central Government employees and Dearness Relief (DR) to Pensioners w.e.f.
Let me talk about the defence sector first.
Why is it that those who ruled the nation for so many years have so many defence scams in their era?
They began with Jeeps and later graduated to weapons, submarines, helicopters.
In the process the defence sector suffered.
If a deal could not happen, defence modernisation could not happen.
Who is every deal maker close to?
And Lutyens Delhi, surely knows.
It is common knowledge that one of the things our armed forces regularly need are bullet proof jackets.
In 2009, our forces made a request for One lakh Eighty Six thousand bullet proof jackets.
You would be ashamed to know that not one, I repeat not one bullet proof jacket was obtained from 2009 to 2014.
In our tenure we bought Two lakh thirty thousand bullet proof jackets!
Now, let me talk of doles.
Those in power loved giving doles.
These doles were not aimed at empowering the poor.
These doles were given so that the poor remain poor and remain at the mercy of the political class.
The best example of this is the farm loan waivers.
No economist or policy expert will ever say farm loan waivers can solve our agrarian issues.
It is a temporary balm at best.
Every ten years, UPA came out with a farm loan waiver idea.
They did nothing in their full tenure but at the eleventh hour, offered a farm loan.
There is nothing tangible in their waivers.
It benefits less than 20% of the farmers.
Yet, they love to fight polls on farm loans.
We have taken a different approach.
The PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, a comprehnsive scheme for farmer welfare.
No dole or deal – only good deed.
Six Thousand rupees in three parts to 12 crore farmers of India.
The scheme was announced on 1st February and launched on 24th February.
We worked 24 hours non-stop and launched it in 24 days!
And unlike waivers, PM Kisan Samman Nidhi is a long term and long lasting assistance.
It was the NDA Government that had the honour of bringing a historic hike in MSP for farmers.
When the previous Government was in power, a file for MSP was kept in cold storage for almost seven years.
Thus, while they work for 10% commission, we work with 100% mission and when a Government works with a strong mission,
all-round development becomes possible.
Our fifty five months and the fifty five years of the others have given two contrasting approaches to governance.
They had a ‘token approach’, we have a ‘total approach.’
India has been battling poverty but they gave a token slogan- Garibi Hatao.
How to achieve that was not specified and neither did they make any effort to remove poverty.
But, they went place to place saying – Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao.
It was known that India needed to work on financial inclusion.
Before 2014 what was their poll plank – increasing gas cylinders from 9 to 12.
Imagine – such a large national party, with years in government is reduced to fighting a poll on 9 to 12 cylinders.
This way of giving tokens is not acceptable to us.
If work has to be done, it has to be in totality, not with tokenism.
That is why, all our initiatives aim for one hundred percent.
Jan Dhan – financial inclusion and banking for all.
Housing for All – a house for every Indian by 2022.
And, we are making remarkable progress in this direction.
Healthcare for All – Ayushman Bharat – no Indian must be deprived of good and affordable healthcare.
50 crore Indians will benefit from this scheme.
One Rank One Pension – compare their 500 crore to the Thirty Five thousand crore that was eventually given by the NDA government as a part of OROP.
Ujjwala Yojana – while they were busy between 9 and 12 cylinders,
we have worked to give smoke free kitchens to crores of families.
Power for all – every village and every household should have electricity.
So, you can see, we are working with both speed and scale.
Everything has to be for all, not a select few.
Enough of tokenism, the time has come for a total transformation where the fruits of development reach each and every citizen.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Swami Vivekananda, on his birth anniversary.
Mr. Miroslav Lajcak, President-elect of the United Nations General Assembly and Minister of Foreign & European Affairs of Slovak Republic called on Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.

PM spoke to Nepal PM Shri K. P. Oli.
He expressed concern on the incident and requested for details.
On supply of fuel and other essentials, PM assured that there is no obstacle from the Indian side.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on Cooperation in the Field of Skill Development, Vocational Education and Training.
The MoU would pave the way for closer bilateral cooperation between the two countries in the field of vocational education and training and skill development.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi addressed the nation today.
One such moment is today.
India has successfully tested the Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Missile.
Congratulations to everyone on the success of Mission Shakti.
It shows the remarkable dexterity of India’s outstanding scientists and the success of our space programme.
Mission Shakti is special for 2 reasons:
(1) India is only the 4th country to acquire such a specialised & modern capability.
(2) Entire effort is indigenous.
India stands tall as a space power!
The Union Cabinet Chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has has been apprised of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Indian Railways and SNCF Mobilites (a company owned by the French State) on Technical Cooperation in the field of Railways.
The MoU was signed on 10th March, 2018.
The MoUs provide a platform for Indian Railways to interact and share the latest developments and knowledge in the railway sector.
The two leaders visited various stalls that highlighted technologies and innovations across diverse fields.
Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that innovation has a key role to play in bringing the people of India and Israel, closer to each other.

He said the youth of India has energy and enthusiasm.
What the youth needs is a bit of encouragement and institutional support, he added.
The Prime Minister spoke of cooperation between India and Israel for innovation in areas such as food, water, health and energy.
A 30-member delegation from the Gujarati Association, Malaysia, called on Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today.
The delegation is currently on a visit to India.
The members of the delegation conveyed their best wishes to the Prime Minister for fulfilling his vision for India’s development.
The Prime Minister said that the MSME sector is crucial for the economic progress of India.
He said MSMEs must match global quality control standards.
The Prime Minister said that a spirit of entrepreneurship among Dalits will benefit us.
He added that there are youngsters whose dreams are to create enterprises and jobs.
Slowdown in global trade is a major concern.
Prospects for increase in trade momentum remain bleak in the prevailing global economic environment.
Efforts to accelerate global economic growth will help trade.
A transparent, equitable, non-discriminatory and rule-based global trading system, is essential for the global economy.
Increasing the role of small and medium enterprises in the global value chain will help expand global employment.
Balanced and sustainedglobal economic growth also needs increase in labour mobility and skill portability.
With respect to energy, there are three basic challenges: energy to power growth in developing countries; meeting the needs of the hundreds of millions without access to energy; and, increasing the use of clean and renewable energy.
Energy, ecology and economy are deeply integrated.
That is why India intends to meet its vast and growing energy needs in as sustainable manner as possible.
We are working on clean coal technology.
We have an ambitious expansion plan for nuclear energy.
By 2030, we have targeted 40% of our energy through non-fossil fuel.
International support and cooperation will enable us to achieve our goals.
As G20, we need to promote a number of measures:-
• Increase financial support and technology transfer to increase access and transition to clean energy.
• Focus research efforts on clean coal technology and coal gasification.
• Develop proliferation-resistant nuclear energy technology.
• Increase energy efficiency and moderate energy use.
• Promote an integrated global gas market.
• Give greater voice to major emerging economies in the global governance structure for energy.
Cabinet approves Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana – Scheme for Providing Free LPG connections to Women from BPL Households
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana – Scheme for Providing Free LPG connections to Women from BPL Households.
Under the scheme, Rs 8000 crore has been earmarked for providing five crore LPG connections to BPL households.
The Scheme provides a financial support of Rs 1600 for each LPG connection to the BPL households.
The identification of eligible BPL families will be made in consultation with the State Governments and the Union Territories.
This Scheme would be implemented over three years, namely, the FY 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.
This is the first time in the history of the country that the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas would implement a welfare scheme benefitting crores of women belonging to the poorest households.
In our country, the poor have limited access to cooking gas (LPG).
The spread of LPG cylinders has been predominantly in the urban and semi-urban areas with the coverage mostly in middle class and affluent households.
But there are serious health hazards associated with cooking based on fossil fuels.
According to WHO estimates, about 5 lakh deaths in India alone due to unclean cooking fuels.
Most of these premature deaths were due to non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.
Indoor air pollution is also responsible for a significant number of acute respiratory illnesses in young children.
According to experts, having an open fire in the kitchen is like burning 400 cigarettes an hour.
Providing LPG connections to BPL households will ensure universal coverage of cooking gas in the country.
In this direction, Finance Minister in Budget speech on 29.2.2016 had announced a budgetary provision of Rs. 2000 crore for 2016-17 to provide deposit free LPG connections to 1.5 crore women belonging to the Below Poverty Line (BPL) families.
“My thoughts are with those who lost their loved ones due to the derailment of Jagdalpur-Bhubaneswar Express.

During the interaction with the Prime Minister, the children thanked the Prime Minister for introducing the new series of coins.

Of late, News of abundant rainfall has been steadily coming in.
At places, we are hearing of rising concerns on account of excessive showers; at some places, people are anxiously waiting for the rains to begin.
The vastness and diversity of India, in fact, at times even rains play hide & seek through partiality laced likes & dislikes.
But why should we blame the rains!
After all it was humankind that chose the path of conflict with Nature and consequently earnt her periodic wrath.
All of you must have watched it on T.V… in Thailand a team of 12 teenaged football players and their coach went on an excursion to a cave.
Usually it takes a few hours to enter and exit that cave.
But destiny had different plans that day.
Barely had they entered deep into the cave that a sudden heavy downpour caused water logging at the inlet of the cave.
Their exit was completely blocked.
Not able to find a way out, they perched themselves a top a mound inside the cave; not for a day or two, but an entire 18 days.
One can only imagine the predicament of these teenagers in the face of death, where every second was fraught with danger.
The sense of responsibility & commitment, prevailing at every level was astonishing.
The government, their parents, family members, media, citizens of that country, each one of them displayed an awe-inspiring sense of peace and patience.
All of them came together as a team to accomplish their mission.
I feel the self-control exercised by each one of them in conduct is worth understanding and emulating.
It is not that the parents were not aggrieved, it is not that the mothers’ eyes had ceased to be moist.
Their patience, their restraint, in fact the calm composure exercised by the entire society is commendable & worth following.
During the operation, a sailor from Thailand Navy sacrificed his life.
The whole world is be wildered at the way they held on with courage and patience, without losing hope, despite the odds against them in the water-logged dark cave.
This proves that when humanity stands together, it creates wonders.
What is certainly required is focusing on your goal with a calm & steady demeanour and the will to strive.
A few days ago, the country’s beloved poet Neeraj Ji left us forever.
Neeraj ji was blessed with a special quality… it was a combination of hope, faith, a firm resolve and self-confidence.
Every word of Neeraj ji’s work can instill a lot of strength & inspiration in us Indians.
The darkness shall be dispelled
Whether you brew up storms
Or make lightening strike
This is the time which is Peak season for colleges.
The attention of students steers from home to hostel.
Students submit themselves to the tutelage of Professors vis a vis the shadow of their parents.
I firmly believe that my young friends must be enthusiastic & happy on the commencement of their college life.
Leaving home for the first time, moving out of one’s village, coming out of a protective environment amounts to taking charge of the course of one’s life.
This multitude of young people leave their homes for the first time to chart a new direction for their lives.
In his maiden attempt, he cracked the Entrance exam for MBBS at AIIMS, Jodhpur.
His father earns his daily bread by waste-picking.
I congratulate him on his success.
There are many such instances of students from deprived families who, through sheer determination & perseverance overcame all odds and stood out to be beacons of inspiration to others.
If we look around, we can see many such examples.
Any commendable incident from any part of the country infuses my heart with energy and inspires me.
And when I mention the glorious journey of these youth, I am reminded of Neeraj ji’s line which sum up the raison d’etre of life.
And I wish to conquer the might of the sword
My dear countrymen, a few days ago I happened to glance through a news item, it said- “Two youths make Modi’s dream come true”.
On reading further, I came to know how our youngsters put in efforts to transform the lives of the common man by making smart and creative use of technology.
I had made an appeal to change brain-drain into brain-gain.
Two IT Professionals from Rae Bareilly Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Bajpayee ji accepted my challenge and made a unique attempt.
With their joint efforts, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have developed a SmartGaonApp by utilizing their professional skills.
This App is not only connecting the villagers with the whole world but now they can obtain any information on their own mobile phones.
Residents of the village Taudhakpur in Rae Bareilly, village chief, District Magistrate, CDO and every one joined in to create awareness amongst the masses.
This App contains phone directory, News section, events list, health centre and information centre of the village.
If you look into this incident minutely, one thing will strike you and that is the young man living in America adhering to that country’s life-style and ideology, who left India many years ago but, knows the finer details about his village, knows about the challenges and still is emotionally attached to his village.
This seems to be the reason as to how he could develop this App which is most suited to needs of the village.
A sense of belonging towards the village and towards one’s roots and also a spirit to show and do something is naturally there in each and every Indian.
We should also check if such a thing has happened in our case too whether circumstances, situations, distances have made us alien, whether dust has gathered over our determinations.
Santoshji, many – many thanks for your phone call.
Actually, Pandharpur Wari is an amazing journey in itself.
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which fell on 23rd July, is celebrated as a day of grand transformation of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a holy town in Solapur district in Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi warkari or pilgrims start the Pandharpur Yatra on foot.
This yatra (journey) is known as Wari and lakhs of warkaris join this.
Pilgrims go to have a darshan of Vitthal who is also known as Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vitthal safeguards the interests of the poor, the deprived ones and the ones who are suffering.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana have deep devotion and respect for Vitthal.
Visiting Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and its grandeur, beauty and spiritual bliss is a unique experience in itself.
I request the listeners of “Mann Ki Baat” to visit Pandharpur Wari at least once, whenever they get a chance.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ram Dass, Tukaram are relevant even today in educating the masses.
We get the mantra to enable the society to fight against blind-faith through devotion and bhakti.
One such great man has been Lok Manya Tilak who has left a very deep impression on the hearts of a large number of Indians.
We remember and pay our homage to Tilak ji on his birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and self-confidence.
He had the courage to show a mirror to the British about their wrong doings.
I want to narrate an interesting incident to the countrymen which is connected with Lok Manya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When in October 1916, Lok Manya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, more than 40,000 people that time gave him a welcome and during that very visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had a chance to talk to him.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was greatly impressed by Lok Manya Tilakji.
When on August 1 1920, Lok Manya Tilakji passed away, Patel ji had decided then itself that he would build his statue in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad municipal corporation and he immediately selected Victoria Garden as a venue for Lok Manya Tilak’s memorial and this was the very Victoria Garden which was named after the British Queen.
The British were naturally not happy with this and the collector continually kept denying permission.
And this all happened during the period of British rule.
Tradition of publicly celebrating Ganesh Utsav was also initiated with the efforts of Lok Manya Tilakji.
The celebration of Ganesh Utsav publicly had become an effective medium in promoting a spirit of social awakening, integration, amity and equality among the masses besides projecting a sense of dedication and festivity in them.
Such events gained more popularity with the passage of time.
Thus, it becomes clear that our younger generations still care for the brave heroes of our ancient past, its heritage and history.
I will surely send your ideas and efforts to the people.
Azad’s courage and passion for freedom inspired the youth of the day.
Chandrashekhar Azad put his life on the stake, but he never bowed in front of the foreign rule.
It was my privilege and good fortune that I had the opportunity of going to Chandrasekhar Azad’s native village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I bow and pay tributes to the two great sons of Bharat Mata – Lokmanya Tilakji and Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland, India’s brave daughter and a farmer daughter Hima Das made history by winning the gold medal in the 400-meter race event.
Ekta in her e-mail writes – ‘The most important moment in the life of any athlete is that when he or she holds the tricolor and I am proud that I could do that.’
Ekta, we all are proud of you.
You have brought glory to the Nation.
Ekta has won the gold and bronze medals in World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 held in Tunisia.
Her achievement is all the more special because she has made the imposing challenges in her life the key to her success.
I salute Ekta Bhyanji, Yogesh Qathuniaji and Sundar Singh Ji, all of you for your fortitude and passion, and congratulate you!
I wish all of you best wishes for good health, for this month of August imbued with the spirit of patriotism and for many festivals that have continued over centuries.
Many Many Thanks.

We are building roads, airports, rail lines and ports at a quick pace.
Our goods are on the Move.
The Goods and Services Tax has helped us rationalize supply chains and warehouse networks.
Our reforms are on the Move.
We have made India an easier place to do business.
Our lives are on the Move.
Families are getting homes, toilets, smoke-free LPG cylinders, bank accounts and loans.
Our youth are on the Move.
We are fast emerging as the start-up hub of the world.
India is moving ahead with new energy, urgency and purpose
We all know that, mobility has been key to the progress of humanity.
The world is now in the middle of a new mobility revolution.
It is, therefore, important to understand mobility as a wider construct.
Mobility is a key driver of the economy.
It is already a major employer and can create the next generation of jobs.
Mobility is central to urbanization.
Motorized personal vehicles require ever-growing road, parking, and traffic infrastructure.
Mobility is critical to preserving our planet.
Creating a mobility eco-system that is in sync with nature is the need of the hour.
Mobility is the next frontier in our fight against Climate Change.
We have doubled our pace of construction of highways.
We have re-energized our rural road-building programme.
We are promoting fuel efficient and cleaner fuel vehicles.
We have developed low-cost air connectivity in under-served regions.
We are also starting operations on hundreds of new air routes.
We are pushing waterways in addition to traditional modes like rail and road.
We are reducing travel distances in our cities by efficient location of homes, schools and offices.
We have also started data-driven interventions such as intelligent traffic management systems.
In a rapidly transforming mobility paradigm, India has some inherent strengths and comparative advantages.
Our starting point is fresh.
We have little of the legacy of resource-blind mobility.
This gives us the window of opportunity to create an all-new, seamless mobility eco-system.
Our unique identity program, Aadhaar, and its India-stack eco-system, has laid down a comprehensive public digital infrastructure.
It has digitally empowered 850 million of our citizens.
India can demonstrate how such digital infrastructure can be combined with new mobility business models.
Our renewable energy push will ensure that the environmental benefits of electric mobility can be fully realized.
We plan to draw 175 GigaWatts of energy from renewables by 2022.
We are already the fifth largest producer of solar energy in the world.
We are also the sixth largest producer of renewable energy.
We have also championed the cause of solar energy globally through the International Solar Alliance.
We have a fast growing manufacturing base, especially in the automotive sector.
We also have a large, digitally literate, young population.
Big Data is enabling smarter decision-making by better understanding our patterns and needs.
Our focus must also go beyond cars, to other vehicles such as scooters and rickshaws.
Large segments of the developing world depend on these vehicles for mobility.
This includes the elderly, the women and the specially abled.
We need to ensure that public transport is preferred to private modes of travel.
4. Congestion free mobility is critical to check the economic and environment costs of congestion.
Hence, there should be emphasis on ending bottlenecks of networks.
Policies will be designed as a win-win for all, and enable huge opportunities in the automotive sector.
Entrepreneurs should see mobility as a sector with immense opportunity for innovation and growth.
It is a sector where innovation can help solve problems for public good.
I am convinced that the ‘Mobility Revolution’ is an enabler of our growth and development.
When India transforms mobility, it benefits one fifth of mankind.
It also becomes a scaled success story, for others to replicate.
This is the future.
May we all be Nourished
May we work together with great energy
May our intellect be Sharpened
I look forward to see what we can do together.
This summit is just the beginning.
Let us Move ahead.
Thank You Very Much!
Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister asserted that India is home to a unique heritage, where the overriding thought has always been the benefit of mankind.

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi attended Dussehra Celebrations at Madhav Das Park near Red Fort in Delhi, today.
In his address, the Prime Minister encouraged everyone to undertake ‘Sankalp’ of positive contribution for the nation by 2022, when the nation celebrates its 75th year of Independence.
“Indian Festivals are not mere events of festivities but they are also a medium to educate the society, festivals keep us aware about the values in the society, they also teach us to live together as one community”, the Prime Minister said.
Who are visionaries, what are they?
That was to prepare such humans who could realize those dreams and capable, dedicated humans could be made only through education and culture.
They wanted to prepare people in such a way that could help them run their business for a long time.
But Mahamanaji wanted to prepare those great people who could retain the great traditions of India and work for the independence of India, for building the nation with their knowledge and capability.
Both of them wanted to prepare the youth who could do something for the country.
Tradition of Yoga has been there in India for centuries.
The common person has also been attracted personally towards Yoga.
In different corners of the world, yoga has been seen with different curiosity.
But we lived in that mindset that we never felt that our Yoga has the power that can own the world.
Last year when United Nation accepted Yoga as International Yoga Day, 192 countries of the world joined and the world acquired the pride-knowledge.
The world enjoyed its joining with Yoga.
If we feel proud of what we have, the world becomes ready to walk with us.
When this belief is based on the knowledge and has been tested on ideas then it becomes more acceptable.
It has been a continuous effort by the BHU.
I heartily congratulate the students and their families, whom we got the opportunity to honor today.
It is not the ceremony of the end of education and the biggest message of convocation ceremony is that if we have to achieve success in life, if we have to maintain ourselves with the changing trends of life then the first condition is that the student inside us should never fade, should never die.
In this world, only one, who remains student till the end of his life, can achieve this vast creation and the countless dimensions of this huge arrangement.
Today when we are leaving from this convocation ceremony, we have a vast world in front of us.
These are not common initiatives.
When you were a student, your family, society, friends all were patting on your back to do good, go ahead, study more.
But as soon as you come with the certificate, the question arises – what will you do next?
There are many challenges before the country and the world.
Can India play any role to these challenges?
Why not our institutions, our students dream of giving something to the mankind, to the world?
He sees the God in plants, mother in river.
This is the culture where exploitation of nature is treated as crime.
Can the institutions of India, our scientists come forward with some new innovations to save the world from global warming?
Can we show some solid path to world for coming out of these problems?
We are working on how to create and maintain renewable energy and solar energy affordable.
Second initiative is a collaboration of such countries where the impact of sun heat is for more than 300 days in a year.
My best wishes are with all of you.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the Kochi Metro, and travelled briefly on the new metro line.
He later addressed a large gathering at the function to dedicate Kochi Metro to the nation.
Following is the text of the Prime Minister’s address:
I am happy to be part of the inauguration ceremony of Kochi Metro.
I congratulate the people of Kochi on this proud moment.
Kochi, the queen of the Arabian Sea, is an important spice trading centre.
Today it is known as the commercial capital of Kerala.
Kochi ranks first in the total number of international and domestic tourist arrivals in Kerala.
Hence it is fitting that Kochi should have a Metro rail facility.
The city’s population has been rising steadily, and is expected to reach twenty three lakhs by 2021.
Therefore, a mass rapid transport system is essential to address the increasing pressure on urban infrastructure.
This will also contribute to Kochi’s economic growth.
Kochi Metro Rail Limited is a fifty – fifty Joint Venture of Government of India and Government of Kerala.
The Union Government has so far released over two thousand crore rupees for Kochi Metro.
The phase being inaugurated today will operate from Aluva to Palarivattom.
It will cover 13.26 kilometres and eleven stations.
This metro project has several significant features.
It is the first metro project to be commissioned with a modern signalling system called the “Communication Based Train Control Signalling system”.
The coaches reflect the “Make in India” vision.
The Kochi metro integrates the city’s entire public transportation network into a single system.
This system will have a common time-table, common ticketing and centralised `command and control’.
It also focuses on improving last mile connectivity and non-motorised transportation systems in the inner city.
The Kochi Metro has also pioneered an innovative PPP model for ticketing Indian banks and financial institutions are being invited through a bid process to invest in an Automated Fare Collection system.
The selected bank will co-brand the Kochi Metro Fare Card and App with the bank’s name.
I am informed that this Kochi-1 Card is a multi-purpose pre-paid contact-less RuPay card which can be used to travel in the metro and also like a normal debit card.
I am also informed that the Kochi-1 Mobile app has been developed with a long term vision.
The mobile App has an Electronic-wallet integrated to it, which is linked to the Kochi-1 Card.
Initially, it will enable citizens of Kochi to avail of metro services.
Thus, it is a good example of an e-Governance digital platform.
Another noteworthy aspect of this project is that nearly one thousand women and twenty-three transgenders are being selected to work in the Kochi Metro Rail System.
The project is also an example of environment friendly development.
It plans to meet nearly twenty five percent of the entire energy requirements from renewable sources, particularly solar energy.
The long-term plan is to become a zero-carbon emitting urban transit system.
Every sixth pillar of the metro system will have a covered vertical garden, which will substantially use urban solid waste.
Over the last three years, my Government has placed special focus on overall infrastructure development of the nation.
Railways, roads, power have been our priority areas.
In PRAGATI meetings, I have personally reviewed nearly 175 projects worth more than eight lakh crore rupees.
We have resolved bottlenecks and significantly improved the average rate of implementation in these sectors.
Now, we are also focusing on next generation infrastructure, which includes logistics, digital and gas.
A number of initiatives have been taken by us to enhance public transport particularly in the cities.
Foreign investment has been invited in this sector.
Fifty cities in India are ready to implement metro rail projects.
The economic and social benefits of metro rail systems are well-known.
We have speeded up policy formulation in this sector.
Recently, the Government of India has standardized the specifications for rolling stock and signalling systems of metro rail.
This will encourage manufacturers to set-up manufacturing facilities in India with a long-term perspective.
In line with the “Make in India” vision, efforts are being made to promote domestic manufacture of metro rolling stock.
Towards this end, the Government of India issued a National Transit Oriented Development Policy in April 2017.
This policy seeks to transform cities, from being transit dependent to being transit oriented.
It aims to create compact walkable communities and bring public transport closer to transit.
I compliment the Union Ministry of Urban Development led by Venkaiah ji for having formulated a Value Capture Finance Policy Framework.
This provides a mechanism to capture the increased land value.
Let me conclude by congratulating the citizens of Kochi, the Kochi Metro Rail Corporation and the Chief Minister of Kerala for achieving this important milestone.
Kochi was selected as a Smart City in Round One of the challenge process in January 2016.
I hope it will do even better in the days to come.
India has a robust strategic partnership with all the three countries.
On 29 May, I will be in Jakarta on the invitation of Indonesian President Joko Widodo.
This is my first visit to Indonesia as Prime Minister.
I will also address the Indian Community in Indonesia.
On 31 May, on my way to Singapore, I will make a brief halt in Malaysia to congratulate the new Malaysian leadership.
I look forward to meet Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad.
In Singapore I will be focusing on enhancing India-Singapore partnership in areas of Fintech, skill development, urban planning and artificial intelligence.
Singapore entities have become major partners with India in areas like urban development, planning, smart cities and infrastructure development.
My visit in Singapore presents an opportunity for both countries to engage further.
On 31 May, I will visit the India-Singapore enterprise and innovation exhibition.
On 1 June, I will call on Singapore President Halimah Yacob.
That evening, I will deliver the keynote address at Shangri-La Dialogue.

On 2 June, I will unveil a plaque at Clifford Pier, where Gandhiji’s ashes were immersed in sea on 27 March 1948.
I would also visit some places of worship that have civilizational linkages with India.
The event has been organized, as part of the centenary celebrations of the Satyagraha led by Mahatma Gandhi, in Champaran.
On this occasion, the Prime Minister launched several important development projects as well.
In the Water Supply and Sanitation sector, he unveiled a plaque to mark the foundation stone of Motijheel Project, the Bettiah Nagar Parishad Water Supply Scheme, and four Ganga Projects, namely: the Saidpur Sewage Network, Patna; the Pahari Sewage Network, Zone 4, Patna; the Pahari Sewagw Network, Zone 5, Patna; and the Pahari STP project.
In the Railways sector, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of the doubling of railway lines between Muzaffarpur and Sagauli; and Sagauli and Valmikinagar.
He dedicated the first phase of the Madhepura Electric Locomotive Factory to the nation.
Via video link, he flagged off the first 12000 HP Freight Electric Locomotive, and the Champaran Humsafar Express.
He also distributed awards to Champion Swachhagrahis.
Addressing an enthusiastic gathering on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that the atmosphere at Motihari today, evokes the same spirit of mass movement, that marked the Champaran Satyagraha, a century ago.
He said that in this journey of Satayagraha to Swachhagraha, the people of Bihar have shown their ability to lead.
He noted the remarkable progress made in toilet construction in Bihar in the last one week.
He appreciated the efforts of the people of the State, and the State Government for the same.
The Prime Minister said that whether it is the Swachh Bharat Mission, or the fight against corruption, or the development of civic amenities, the Union Government is working shoulder to shoulder with the State Government.
He mentioned that 11 projects worth more than Rs 3000 crore have been approved so far, to prevent waste water from entering the River Ganga.
He said that about 50 lakh women had benefited from LPG connections through the Ujjwala Yojana, in the State of Bihar.
In this context, he also mentioned the LPG and petroleum projects launched today.
He said the 12000 HP engines, the first of which rolled out today, will help in significantly improving the speeds of goods trains.
He said that the work for this project, which was first approved in 2007, began three years ago, and the first phase has already been completed.
He said the Union Government is committed to fulfilling all its missions and resolves, with the help of the people.
Speaking of the achievements in sanitation, the Prime Minister mentioned that sanitation coverage has expanded from about 40 percent in 2014, to about 80 percent today.

Hence all of us should join hands together in the parliament to give a new impetus and direction to country.
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today unveiled a plaque to mark the inauguration of the new building complex of the Bombay Art Society.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister remarked that rarely has an institution left its imprint on three centuries.

He said that the reason for this is that art has its own strength and message.
The Prime Minister emphasized that art is not just an adornment for walls, but a pillar of strength for society.
He said art can play a key role in all-round personality development of children.
He said art helps in keeping the human spirit alive in individuals, even in this machine age.

Minister for Agriculture & Forests, Royal Government of Bhutan and Chairman, Global Tiger Forum,
Distinguished Ministers from Tiger Range Countries,
Shri Prakash Javadekar, our Minister for Environment, Forest & Climate Change,
Other dignitaries on the dais, delegates from Tiger Range Countries, Ladies and Gentlemen!
I am pleased to welcome you all.
The tiger has brought all of us together here.
Your very presence is a testimony to the importance your country attaches to this “umbrella” among species.
As we all know, the tiger is an apex consumer in the ecological pyramid and food chain.
In fact, the benefits from tiger conservation are enormous but intangible.
We cannot quantify this in economic terms.
Putting a price tag on nature is difficult.
In India, the tiger is much more than just a wild animal.
In fact, most of our Gods and Goddesses are associated with some animal, tree or river.
In fact sometimes these animals are put on the same pedestal as Gods and Goddesses.
No wonder the Tiger is also our national animal.
I am sure, other Tiger Range Countries would have some cultural legacy associated with tigers.
Species belonging to the animal kingdom, usually do not act to their disadvantage.
However, human beings are an exception.
Here, I recall the famous words of Gautam Buddha who said: “the forest is a peculiar organism of unlimited kindness.
The Global Tiger Recovery Programme was an important outcome of these efforts.
I also appreciate the initiatives of Mr. Dorji, the Chairman of the Global Tiger Forum.
However, from what I have been told it appears that tiger habitats have reduced drastically across Tiger Range Countries.
The situation has been aggravated further by the ongoing trafficking in body parts and derivatives of this magnificent animal.
In India too, we have been facing the challenge of poaching and disruption in their ecosystems.
Forests are inseparable from wild animals.
Both are mutually complementary.
Destruction of one leads to destruction of the other.
This is an important cause of climate change which is now affecting us adversely in many ways.
This is a global phenomenon which all of us are grappling with.
Tiger conservation is a collective responsibility of the Government of India and States.
I also compliment our State governments for their efforts.
But the efforts of Government cannot succeed unless they are supported by the people.
Our cultural legacy which encourages compassion and co-existence has played an important role in the success of Project Tiger.
Our National Tiger Conservation Authority has taken many landmark initiatives.
Use of modern technology, including intelligent, infrared and thermal cameras on a 24×7 basis is being promoted for surveillance against poaching in sensitive tiger reserves.
Several protocols for smart patrolling and tiger monitoring have been evolved.
Radio telemetry is also being promoted to monitor tigers.
A national repository of tiger camera trap photo database is also being created.
To do all this, we have, this year, doubled our allocation for tiger conservation.
We have increased it from Rupees 185 crores to Rupees 380 crores; which is 3.8 billion Rupees.
I strongly believe that tiger conservation, or conservation of nature, is not a drag on development.
Both can happen in a mutually complementary manner.
All we need is to re-orient our strategy by factoring in the concerns of the tiger in sectors where tiger conservation is not the goal.
This is a difficult task but can be achieved.
Our genius lies in “smartly” integrating the tiger and wildlife safeguards in various infrastructures at the landscape level.
In the Indian context, we intend to achieve this through the Tiger Conservation Plans.
Considering the ecosystem value of tiger conservation areas, we need to consider them as “natural capital.”
Our institutions have done an economic valuation of a few tiger reserves.
This study has highlighted the fact that besides conserving the tiger, these reserves also provide a range of economic, social, cultural and spiritual benefits.
These are known as ecosystem services.
Thus, we need to define conservation as a means to achieve development, rather than considering it to be anti-growth.
This calls for factoring in the value of the ecosystem in the economic arithmetic of development and growth.
I am confident that we can achieve a framework to foster proactive engagement of industry for conservation.
This is the only inter-governmental organisation of its kind.
It is now working closely with the Global Tiger Initiative Council.
As a host country, I assure you of our fullest support.
We will also be happy to support capacity building of wildlife personnel at the Wildlife Institute of India.
The Tiger Range Countries are signatories to other international conventions to address international trade on endangered species.
In this regard, I want to give you another good news.
We are moving towards formally adopting the statute of South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network.
At the end, I would like to emphasise that conservation of tigers is not a choice.
It is an imperative.
I would also like to emphasise that regional co-operation is essential for combating wildlife crime.
In this conference, let us resolve to work together to protect the tiger and its space.
India is committed to engage with all Tiger Range Countries for this purpose.
The Agreement was signed in Riyadh on 2-3 April, 2016 during the visit of the Prime Minister to Saudi Arabia.
Mahatma Gandhi had once said, “One must care about the world one will not see”.
Indeed, humanity has progressed when it has collectively risen to its obligation to the world and responsibility to the future.
I consider this a very important summit and thank UN Secretary General for organizing it.
Just as our vision behind the Agenda 2030 is lofty, our goals are comprehensive.
It gives priority to the problems that have endured through the past decades.
And, it reflects our evolving understanding of the social, economic and environmental linkages that define our lives.
I speak about Blue Revolution, which includes the prosperity, sustainable use of marine wealth and blue skies.
Today, much of India’s development agenda is mirrored in the Sustainable Development Goals.
Since Independence, we have pursued the dream of eliminating poverty from India.
We have chosen the path of removing poverty by empowering the poor.
We have placed priority on education and skill development.
We are focusing on the basics: housing, power, water and sanitation for all – important not just for welfare, but also human dignity.
These are goals with a definite date, not just a mirage of hope.
We are committed to a sustainable path to prosperity.
We represent a culture that calls our planet Mother Earth.
As our ancient text say:-
Our success will give us more resources to share with our friends.
As India’s ancient saying goes, the wise look at the world as one family.
Nations have a national responsibility for sustainable development.
They also need policy space.
However, we are here today in the United Nations because we all believe that international partnership must be at the centre of our efforts, whether it is development or combating climate change.
And, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is the bedrock of our collective enterprise.
When we speak only of climate change, there is a perception of our desire to secure the comforts of our lifestyle.
When we speak of climate justice, we demonstrate our sensitivity and resolve to secure the future of the poor from the perils of natural disasters.
In addressing climate change, it is important to focus on solutions that can help us reach our goals.
We should forge a global public partnership to harness technology, innovation and finance to put affordable clean and renewable energy within the reach of all.
Equally, we must look for changes in our lifestyles that would make us less dependent on energy and more sustainable in our consumption.
I hope that the Developed World will fulfil its financing commitments for development and climate change, without in any way putting both under the same head!
As we see now, distance is no insulation from challenges.
There is no cause greater than shaping a world, in which every life that enters it can look to a future of security, opportunity and dignity; and, where we leave our environment in better shape for the next generation.
And, no cause that is more challenging.
At 70, we are called to rise to that challenge, with our wisdom, experience, generosity, compassion, skills and technology.
I am confident that we can.

He said that this Government, instead, is surrounded by expectations.
He said that when hope gives rise to expectations, it gives us energy to move faster towards Suraj.
The Prime Minister said that he wishes to focus not on the work done by the Government, but on its work-culture.
The Prime Minister defined various attributes of Suraj, such as Sensitivity, Responsibility, Accountability, Transparency, Efficiency and Good Governance.
He illustrated each of these attributes through examples of the working of the Union Government, in areas such as online registration in major hospitals, promptness of income tax refunds, speeding up the process of passport delivery, faster company registrations, and ending interviews for Group C and Group D positions in the Government.
The Prime Minister mentioned how the speed of delivery in vital areas of governance had increased.
In this context, he gave examples such as rural roads construction, renewable energy generation capacity, laying of transmission lines, and cooking gas connections.

As far as practicable, clusters of village would follow administrative convergence units of Gram Panchayats.
For the selection of clusters, the Ministry of Rural Development is adopting a scientific process of cluster selection which involves an objective analysis at the District, Sub District and Village level, of the demography, economy, tourism and pilgrimage significance and transportation corridor impact.
While the Ministry, following this analysis, would provide a suggestive list of sub districts to the State, the State Governments would then select the clusters following a set of indicated principles included in the Framework for Implementation.
The mission aims to create 300 such Rurban growth clusters over the next 3 years, across the country.
The funding for Rurban Clusters will be through various schemes of the Government converged into the cluster.
The SPMRM will provide an additional funding support of upto 30 percent of the project cost per cluster as Critical Gap Funding (CGF) as Central Share to enable development of such Rurban clusters.
In addition to the Critical Gap Funding, proactive steps have been taken to ensure the success of the mission with adequate budget provisions for supporting the State Government towards project development, capacity building and other institutional arrangements at the state level.
The Mission envisages institutional arrangements both at the State and Center to ensure smooth implementation of the Mission.

I am delighted to be here with you all at the India-South Africa Business Forum.
We are deeply honoured to have with us, Your Excellency Mr. President.

Now, our partnership is about a shared and prosperous future, which realizes the dreams of Madiba and Mahatma for our people.
We seek constantly to engage and collaborate for a better future for our people, and also the world.
We sealed a strategic partnership 22 years ago through the Red Fort Declaration.
I believe that continuous dialogue between the two old friends and partners has brought us closer in every way.
However, there is great potential still.
In my earlier role as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I was happy to welcome prominent participants from South Africa.
It is gratifying that the Vibrant Gujarat last week once again welcomed our friends and partners from South Africa in large numbers.
One day was specifically marked as ‘Africa Day’.
This shows that our bonds are much deeper than we generally realize.
It also wonderful for our bilateral economic partnership.
Ladies and Gentlemen, India’s economy currently at 2.6 trillion dollars is the fastest growing major economy of the world.
And, we are on our way to becoming the fifth largest economy globally.
India has jumped to the 77th position in the latest edition of World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report – improving 65 places in last four years.
We are one of the top FDI destinations listed by UNCTAD.
But, we are not satisfied.
On a daily basis, we are making necessary changes and reforms in important sectors of the economy.
Our special programmes such as Make in India, Digital India and Start-Up India have caught the imagination of the world.
Our Government is making all efforts to increase the living standards of our 1.3 billion people, who form one-sixth of the humanity.
We wish you well in your efforts to attract Foreign Direct Investment into South-Africa, as well as for the creation of over one million jobs for the youth in three years.
I am happy that India is contributing to these objectives.
Our investment into South Africa is constantly growing.
This has approached 10 billion dollars, creating over 20,000 jobs locally.
As a brotherly nation, India will be happy to share its experience in policy reforms and setting up ground level agencies.
I assure you that New India would welcome you to look at all available opportunities, particularly in Food & Agro processing, Deep mining, Defence, Fin-tech, Insurance and Infrastructure sectors.
Likewise, India could also partner with South Africa in Start-ups, Health care & Pharma, Bio-tech, IT and IT enabled sectors.
We are delighted to be a part of the South Africa skills story through the recent launch of the Gandhi Mandela Skills Institute.
This initiative seeks to empower the youth.
Another important collaboration between our two countries could be in the Gems and Jewelry sector.
Both countries could explore avenues for direct procurement of diamond.
It will ensure economies of scale, and also reduce the cost for both buyers and sellers.
South Africa could also join hands with India in our campaign for New and Renewable Energy, specifically through the “International Solar Alliance”.
Simplification of the existing visa regime for business-men and tourists, and direct connectivity would further ease business and people-to-people exchanges.
There is huge untapped potential in the India-South Africa partnership.
We must work together for a new era of shared growth and prosperity for the benefit of our two countries and peoples.
The visit of Your Excellency provides us with a vital opportunity to take this relationship forward.
I am committed, Excellency, to work shoulder-to-shoulder with you in this shared endeavor.

Energy is a key driver of economic growth.
Sustainable, stable and reasonably priced energy is essential for the fruits of economic development to reach the bottom of the pyramid.
Hydrocarbons will remain the most important source of energy for many years to come.
Therefore, the theme of the Conference “Hydrocarbons to Fuel the Future, Choices and Challenges” is both apt and timely.
India is today the world’s fastest growing large economy.
This growth has been supported by a series of policy measures.
Our policies are focussed on improving India’s long term economic and social prospects, rather than on short term headlines.
Our efforts are showing results in terms of economic growth and development.
Apart from fast growth, our economy has also been more stable than most others.
While the global economy is going through a period of uncertainty, India has shown tremendous resilience.
Foreign Direct Investment in India was at the highest level in 2015-16, at a time when global FDI has fallen.
According to the Bank of International Settlements, India is less vulnerable to banking distress among the major economies.
India’s economy is expected to grow five fold by 2040.
As per estimates, India is poised to account for one fourth of the incremental global energy demand between 2013 and 2040.
India is expected to consume more oil in 2040 than the whole of Europe.
Transport infrastructure is also expected to increase manifold.
The commercial vehicle population of thirteen million is projected to reach fifty six million by 2040.
Growth in the aviation sector is expected to raise demand for aviation fuel four times by 2040.
All this will affect energy demand.
Hydrocarbons will continue to play an important part in India’s growth.
The prospect of rapid growth places a large responsibility on India’s energy sector.
I am glad that so many participants from India and abroad have taken the time to come here.
I am sure all of us will benefit from the experience and expertise of each other.
Energy in general and hydrocarbons in particular are an important part of my vision for India’s future.
India needs energy which is accessible to the poor.
It needs efficiency in energy use.
As a responsible global citizen, India is committed to combating climate change, curbing emissions and ensuring a sustainable future.
Given global uncertainties, India also needs energy security.
Let me start with energy access.
It also reduces their productivity.
We have launched the Ujjwala programme to provide fifty million families with access to cooking gas.
In one stroke, this programme improves health, increases productivity and reduces harmful emissions.
This programme has already provided nearly ten million new connections in just seven months.
The Government also aims to extend Piped Natural Gas to ten million houses over the next five years.
We are building a new gas pipeline to the least developed eastern region which will become the catalyst for millions of new jobs.
We are working to ensure that every village in India has access to electricity by March 2018.
Let me now turn to energy efficiency.
India’s commercial transport sector has become skewed.
An increasing proportion of goods is transported by road.
To increase energy efficiency, my government has given the highest ever priority to the railways.
We have stepped up public capital investment in railways by more than one hundred per cent between 2014-15 and 2016-17.
We are completing dedicated freight corridors.
We are constructing a high speed rail corridor between Mumbai and Ahmedabad which will be more energy efficient than air travel.
By removing physical barriers at state boundaries, GST will accelerate long haul transport and further increase efficiency.
Oil ministers from developing countries know the sensitivity of energy pricing.
Despite this, we have de-controlled petrol and diesel prices.
Cooking gas price is also determined by the market.
To protect the vulnerable and the middle class, a subsidy is paid directly to one hundred and sixty nine million bank accounts.
This has eliminated leakages and misuse of cooking gas subsidies, resulting in large fiscal saving.
These measures too have increased the efficiency of energy use.
R&D on second and third generation biofuels and fuel cells are required to meet the country’s energy challenges.
Let me now turn to energy security.
We need to increase our domestic oil and gas production and reduce import dependence.
We have a strong, investment friendly policy framework in place to boost domestic hydrocarbon production.
Almost two decades ago, India had introduced the New Exploration Licensing Regime.
This allowed one hundred per cent FDI and provided an opportunity to private players to come, invest and operate in the Indian upstream sector.
However, several factors adversely affected India’s domestic oil and gas output.
The resulting competition will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our marketing companies.
Our proactive foreign policy and energy diplomacy is helping us to strengthen our ties with our neighbouring countries.
I hope that our oil and gas sector companies will take the opportunity to tie up with their foreign counterparts to explore for more equity oil.
Recent acquisitions of hydrocarbon assets in Russia by investing 5.6 billion dollars for fifteen million tonnes of equity oil equivalent, are one such instance.
Indian energy companies must become multinational; and work towards India-Middle East, India-Central Asia, and India-South Asia energy corridors.
Natural gas will also have an important balancing role to play as India’s renewable energy production rises.
This is an area that India needs to improve upon to remain competitive.
This will not only improve our refining and processing efficiencies but also ensure timely and efficent project completion.
India has always been an inspiration for others in terms of intellectual capability and enterprise.
My message to global hydrocarbon companies is: We invite you to come and Make in India.
Our constant efforts have improved India’s ranking in Ease of Doing Business.
Let me assure you that our commitment is strong and our motto is to replace Red Tape with Red Carpet.
I assure you of all possible support from the Government.

The Visiting Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong in an op-ed titled, “Revive a millennial partnership: Singapore has played a major role in India’s closer integration with ASEAN” published in the Times of India today writes that the age old trade, commerce and cultural linkages between India and ASEAN have played a major role in giving a boost to the ties.
He writes that as we commemorate 25 years of ASEAN -India relations, India’s ties with southeast Asia date back more than 2,000 years.
Ancient trade between India and countries such as Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand is well-documented.

Mr. Philippe Etienne, Diplomatic Advisor to the President of the French Republic called on the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.

The Prime Minister fondly recalled his successful visit to France in June 2017.
The Prime Minister said that defence and security are two important pillars of the India-France Strategic Partnership, and appreciated the growing bilateral engagement in all sectors.
I welcome you all to this important meeting of the Inter State Council.
There are only a few occasions when the leadership of the Centre and the States, assembles together.
This forum of cooperative federalism is the perfect setting to deliberate on the interests of the people, address their problems, and take collective and concrete decisions.
It highlights the vision of the makers of our Constitution.
I, therefore, urge the States to increasingly use this forum as an effective instrument to strengthen our democracy, our society and our polity.”
The Inter-State Council is certainly the most significant platform for strengthening Centre-State and Inter-State relations.
There has been a long hiatus since the last meeting in 2006, but I am happy that through the efforts of Home Minister Rajnath Singh ji, the process has been restarted.
Over the last one year, he has convened meetings of five zonal councils.
The increased dialogue and connect has culminated in this gathering today.
The nation can progress only if the Union and State Governments walk shoulder to shoulder.
It would be difficult for any Government to successfully implement a scheme on its own.
Therefore, provision of adequate financial resources is as important as the responsibility for implementation.
With the acceptance of the 14th Finance Commission recommendations, the States’ share in central taxes has increased from 32 per cent to 42 per cent.
This means that States now have greater financial resources to utilize in accordance with their requirements.
I am happy to share that the total amount received by States from the Centre during 2015-16 is 21 per cent higher than the amount received in 2014-15.
Similarly, Panchayats and Urban Local Bodies will receive 2.87 lakh crore rupees during the period of the 14th Finance Commission, which is substantially higher than last time.
Auctions of other mines will yield an additional 18,000 crore rupees to states.
Similarly, through amendments to CAMPA Act, we are attempting to free up about 40,000 crore rupees lying idle in banks, for disbursal to States.
The supply of LPG will further increase.
All these efforts have a direct bearing on the consumption of kerosene.
Recently, the Chandigarh administration declared the city a kerosene-free zone.
Now, the Union Government has launched a scheme, under which, if there is a reduction in the consumption of kerosene by a State, the Centre will disburse 75 per cent of the resultant savings in subsidy, as grant to that State.
Parliament has passed the Aadhaar Act-2016.
The passage of this Act enables us to use Aadhaar for Direct Cash Transfers for subsidy and other services.
As on date, 102 crore Aadhaar cards have been distributed in our country of 128 crore people.
79 per cent of our people now have Aadhaar cards.
Among adults, 96 per cent people have Aadhaar cards.
With your support, we shall connect every citizen of the country with an Aadhaar card by the year-end.
Today the simple Aadhaar card has become a symbol of empowerment.
Benefits now flow only to people genuinely entitled to receive them, with money getting directly credited to their bank accounts.
This has not only brought in transparency, but also resulted in savings of thousands of crores of rupees, which are being utilized for development.
Friends, Babasaheb Ambedkar had written – “The path of social reform like the path to heaven at any rate in India, is strewn with many difficulties.
Social reform in India has few friends and many critics.”
The words written by him continue to be relevant even today.
Therefore, eschewing criticism, we must lay emphasis on promoting social reform schemes through mutual cooperation.
Many of these schemes have been designed by sub-groups of Chief Ministers under the aegis of the NITI Aayog.
Another important area of discussion in the Inter State Council is Education.
India’s greatest asset is its youth.
More than 30 crore children are currently of school-going age.
But a lot still remains to be done with regard to the standard of education.
We must discuss the extent to which our system of education is genuinely educating our children.
The best way of improving the standard of education among children is to make them aware of the purpose of education.
Merely going to school is not education.
Given the kind of efficiency and ability that is required in the economy of the 21st century, it is our responsibility to ensure that our youth are equipped with at least some skill-sets.
We have to prepare our youth to think logically, think out of the box, and work creatively.
Internal Security is another important issue on the agenda today.
We have to discuss internal security challenges confronting the country, the solutions to these challenges, and mutual cooperation in this regard.
We must constantly remain alert and updated.
The meeting of the Inter State Council provides an opportunity for exchange of views in an extremely free and frank manner.
I am sure you will share your thoughts and suggestions on all the agenda items.
These will be of tremendous value.
The more we are able to forge consensus on these vital issues, the better we shall be able to tackle them.
The Prime Minister also conveyed his good wishes for the strengthening of democracy, peace and prosperity in Maldives under the leadership of Mr Solih.
Mr Solih thanked the Prime Minister for his greetings and good wishes.

The Prime Minister later unveiled a plaque to mark the laying of Foundation Stone of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial at the Indu Mills Compound, in Mumbai.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave away the Ramnath Goenka Awards for excellence in journalism.
Speaking on the occasion, he said that during the freedom struggle, newspapers became a very strong medium of expression.
He added that the colonial rulers were scared of those who wrote and expressed themselves through the papers.
Praising Late Shri Ramnath Goenka, the Prime Minister said that there were few in the media who challenged the Emergency and this was led by Ramnath ji.
He said that he is indeed blessed, to be associated with the project of Kashi Vishwanath Dham.
He complimented the officers involved with the project, for performing their task with devotion.
He thanked all the people who had property around the temple, and have allowed its acquisition for the project.
He said the Kashi Vishwanath Temple has survived the vicissitudes of centuries.
He recalled and praised Queen Ahiyabai Holkar for her work on the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, over two centuries ago.
He said that since then, not much thought had been given by those in power, to the entire area around the Temple.
He said the entire Temple complex is now in the process of rejuvenation, and the results are becoming visible.
He said a direct link is being established between the River Ganga, and Kashi Vishwanath Temple.
I pray that those injured in the bus accident in J&K recover soon.”, the Prime Minister said.
Your Excellency President Xi Jinping,
Your Excellency President Jacob Zuma,
Your Excellency President Dilma Rousseff,
We express our deepest sympathy and support to Russia for the loss of life in Sinai.
Ankara and Beirut are also reminders of terror’s growing spread and impact.
The entire humanity must stand together as one against terrorism.
The need for a united global effort to combat terrorism has never been more urgent.
This must also be a priority for BRICS nations.
There was a time when the logic of BRICS and its lasting capacity were being questioned.
We have provided proof of the relevance and value of BRICS through our actions.
And, this has come at a time of huge global challenges.
The New Development Bank, the Currency Reserve Arrangement, Strategy for BRICS Economic Cooperation – these are clear evidence of our vision and our resolve.
Together, we can also give shape to G20.
India attaches the highest importance to BRICS.
It aptly describes the ethos of our group.
We are pleased that a BRICS partner, China, takes over the Presidency of G20 in December 2015.
Cabinet approves cooperation between Indian and Japan on Railway Safety
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the signing the Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) with Japan on Railway Safety.
The MoC has already been signed in February, 2017.
iii. Rolling stock safety (e.g. maintenance etc.)
The MoC would provide a platform for Indian Railways to interact and share the latest development and knowledge in the railway sector.
The cooperation under this MoC will involve:
The ASRB will now be a 4 Member body instead of 3 Members.

Also, it will benefit the large work force by improving their safety and health, and preventing occupational injuries and diseases.
He said the new civil aviation policy marks an opportunity to cater to the aspirations of the people of India.
Yesterday, one hundred and twenty-five crore Indians celebrated the ParaakramParva, the festival of Valour.
We remembered that surgical strike carried out in 2016, where our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the audacity of a proxy war under the garb of terrorism.
At various places in the country, exhibitions have been organised by our Armed Forces in order to apprise the maximum number of citizens, especially the younger generation, of the might we possess; how capable we are and how our soldiers risk their lives to protect us citizens.
A day such as ParaakaramPrava reminds our youth of the glorious heritage of our Army.
It also inspires us to maintain the unity & integrity of the country.
I too participated in a programme held at Jodhpur in the land of the valiant, Rajasthan.
It has now been decided that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to whosoever makes an attempt to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our Nation.
India has always been resolutely committed to peace.
In the two world-wars fought in the 20th century, over a lakh of our soldiers made the Supreme Sacrifice; that too in a war where we were not involved in any way.
We have never eyed someone else’s territory maliciously.
This in itself was our commitment & dedication towards peace.
A few days ago, on the 23rd of September, on the occasion of the centenary of the Battle of Haifa in Israel, we remembered & paid tributes to our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad & Jodhpur Lancers who had freed Haifa from the clutches of oppressors.
This too was an act of valour on part of our soldiers on the path to peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest contributors to various United Nations Peace Keeping Forces in terms of sending forces personnel.
For decades, our brave soldiers wearing blue helmets have played a stellar role in ensuring maintenance of World Peace.
My dear countrymen, the sky offers the rarest of hues.
We celebrate Air Force Day on the 8th of October.
From the core of my heart, I congratulate those Air Warriors and their families who rendered service to the nation.
The Air Force also retaliated befittingly in 1965 too.
Who does not know about the Bangladesh Freedom Struggle of 1971?
The Air Force played a very significant role in 1999 by pushing back the intruders and liberating Kargil from their clutches.
The Air Force defeated the enemy at Tiger Hill by carrying out air sorties on their positions round the clock.
Be it the relief and rescue work or disaster management, our country is indebted to our Air Force for the commendable efforts of our Air Warrior.
They have always displayed a unique spirit in times of natural calamities like storms, cyclones, floods and forest fires to extend full assistance to our countrymen.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equality and has opened its doors for our daughters of India.
Now, the Air Force is offering the option of Permanent Commission to Women besides the Short Service Commission, which I had announced on the 15th of August this year from the Red Fort.
Indian can proudly claim that in the armed forces,our Army not only man-power but woman-power too is contributing equally.
Women are already empowered and now getting armed too.
The whole country was concerned about saving Tomy.
You know, AbhilashTomy is a very courageous, brave soldier.
He was the first Indian who set on a global voyage in a small boat without any modern technology.
For the last 80 days, he was moving ahead in South Indian Ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race maintaining his speed but suddenly a severe cyclonic storm landed him in trouble.
Yet, this brave heart from the Navy kept struggling for many days in mid-ocean.
I pray for Tomy’s sound health and I am sure that his courage, bravery and resolve to fight and emerge a winner will inspire our younger generation.
My dear countrymen, every child in our country knows the importance of the 2nd of October for our nation.
The 2nd of October, this year, has a special significance.
For two years from now on, we are going to organise various programmes throughout the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy has inspired the whole world.
In today’s Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk about another important work of revered Bapu which maximum countrymen should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started penning down a few thoughts in the shape of a constructive Programme.
Later, in 1945, when the Freedom Struggle gained momentum, he prepared an amended copy of those ideas.
Everyone has experienced this as a most unique part of his personality.
He made everyone feel that he or she was very important and absolutely necessary for the country.
His biggest contribution in the Freedom struggle was that he made it an expansive “Jan-Aandolan” (People’s Movement).
During the Freedom Struggle people from all sections and all regions dedicated themselves at Mahatma Gandhi’s call.
Bapu gave an inspirational mantra to all of us which is known as Gandhiji’s Talisman.
Then, you will see that your doubt is waning away and your ego is also getting quelled.
My dear countrymen, one of Gandhiji’s mantras is very relevant event today.
The swelling middle class of the country, its increasing economic power, increasing purchasing power; can we remember revered Bapu for a moment while going out for shopping!
Can we remember that mantra of Bapu!”
Can we spare a thought while purchasing anything as to who in my country will be benefitted by this purchase!
Whose face will sport a smile!
Who will be the fortunate one to get a direct or indirect benefit from your purchase!
I will feel much happier if my purchase will benefit the poorest of the poor.
Keeping this mantra of Gandhiji in mind while making any purchases during the 150th Anniversary of Gandhiji, we must make it a point to see that our purchase must benefit one of our countrymen and in that too, one who has put in physical labour, who has invested money, who has applied skill must get some benefit.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji said that by maintaining cleanliness, freedom will be won then he probably was not aware how this would happen.
In the same way today we may feel that even by making a tiny contribution I may be contributing in a big way to help in the economic upliftment and economic empowerment of my country and help fight a battle against poverty by lending strength to the poor.
I feel that this is true patriotism, and a perfect tribute to revered Bapu’s work.
This spirit of attachment towards the country and fellow countrymen was deeply imbibed in that great person of a very short physical stature.
Two days later, we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji along with respected Bapu’s birth anniversary.
The very name of Shastriji evokes a feeling of eternal faith in the hearts of us, Indians.
His mild persona always fills every Indian with a sense of pride.
His slogan “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” is the hall mark of his grand personality.
I went to the school, the foundation of which had been laid by none other than respected Baba Saheb himself.
On the 15th of September, people from all sections across the country connected themselves to this voluntary cleaning movement.
Institutions also extended their contribution enthusiastically.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, youth organisations, media groups, the corporate world, all of them offered voluntary cleanliness service on a large scale.
I heartily congratulate all these cleanliness-loving countrymen for their efforts.
If you had not made a call about this aspect, perhaps those connected with this cleanliness movement might have also not thought about such a sensitive issue.
I specially thank you for your phone call.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission or Clean India Mission has become a success story not only in our country but in the whole world and everyone is talking about this movement.
This time India is hosting the biggest Sanitation Convention of the world so far, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Sanitation Ministers from countries across the world and experts on the subject of sanitation will converge and share their experiments and experiences.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will conclude on 2nd October, 2018 with the commencement of Bapu’s 150th Birth Anniversary celebrations.
This is specially essential for the freedom and peace of the exploited, victimised and deprived people and to ensure justice for them.
In the Constitution drafted by Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, many provisions were inserted to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the ‘National Human Rights Commission’ (NHRC) was formed on 12th October 1993.
Our most beloved leader, ShriAtalBihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of our country, had clearly said that human rights are not analien concept for us.
In the emblem of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal mantra harking back to Vedic period- “SarveBhavantuSukhinah” is inscribed.
NHRC has instilled widespread awareness of human rights and has played an important role in preventing their misuse.
In its journey of 25 years, it has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence in the countrymen.
For a healthy society, and for lofty democratic values I feel that, it is a very hope inspiring event.
Today, with NHRC operating at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted.
Even this year, we should try to organize ‘Run for Unity’ in our village, town, city or metropolis.
This is the best way to remember SardarSaheb, because he worked for the unity of our nation throughout his lifetime.
His Excellency President of the Republic of South Africa, Mr.Jacob Zuma,
Thank you, Excellency, for your warm words of welcome and for your generous hospitality.
Even though this is my first visit to this great country, my delegation and I already feel at home in this Rainbow Nation.
For this, Excellency,we are deeply gratefulto you.
For me personally, this visit is an opportunity to pay homage to two of the greatest human souls to have ever walked this Earth – Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Our shared values, suffering and struggles provide a strong foundation to our strategic partnership.
Two way trade has grownby over 300 percent in last ten years.
Indian companies hold strong business interests in South Africa.
About one fourth of our investments in Africa are in this country.
The nature of our developing economies demands that our engagement should also focus on improving our human capital.
Our capacities and needs in the fields of vocational, technical and professional education complement each other, and can benefit both our people.
India is also ready to share it’s expertise and capacities for the development of small and medium business in South Africa.
Beyond economic ties, and links of business, trade and investment, we can also partner in the field of defence and security.
Both, at the level of industry and for our strategic and security needs.
In India, this is one of the sectors witnessing a complete transformation.
It offers exciting opportunities in defence trade.
Our companies can also pool their capacities to jointly develop or manufacture defence equipments and platforms.
And, not just to meet our defence needs, but also to respond to regional and global demand.
President Zuma and I also agreed on the need to work more closely on international issues and emerging global challenges.
I thanked the President for South Africa’s support to India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
We know that we can count on the active support of our friends, like South Africa.
Climate change, and its impact on the world, is our shared concern.
We agreed that a large scale effort and focus on renewable energy is needed to address this challenge.
It was with this in mind that India had led the efforts to form an International Solar Alliance at COP 21 in Paris.
Terrorism is another shared threat that puts at risk the safety and security of our people.
It attacks the very foundations of our society.
The President and I agreed that our two nations need to stay vigilant and cooperate actively to combat terrorism, both in our region and in the world.
The waters of the Indian Ocean are our common sea frontiers.
And, the Indian Ocean Rim Association has emerged as a key platform of engagement for the maritime neighbours connected by the Indian Ocean.
I welcome South Africa’s chairmanship of the organization for 2017-19.
India and South Africa are also working together to shape priorities of international agenda through IBSA [India, Brazil and South Africa] and BRICS.
I look forward to welcoming President Zuma in Goa for the BRICS Summit later this year, in October.
Let me say this in the end:
Our relationship has been a story of resolve, determination, justice and the excellence of human endeavour.It is truly exceptional and unlike any other.

Dr. Jayachandran was known for his efforts of making the most economical treatment possible available to the poor.
People tell us that he would be ever ready & eager, when it came to treatment of patients.
In the case of elderly patients, he would even bear the cost of their travelling to and fro.
On the betterindia.com website, I have read about many of his endeavours that serve as an inspiration to society.
On similar lines, on the 25th of December, I learnt of the loss of SulagittiNarsamma in Karnataka.
SulagittiNarsamma was a midwife, aiding pregnant women during childbirth.
In Karnataka, especially in far-off, remote places, thousands of women availed of her services.
In the beginning of this year, she was honoured with a Padma Shri.
There are many exemplary personalities such as Dr. Jaya Chandran and SulagittiNarsamma, who dedicated their lives to the welfare of all in society.
Since we are referring to healthcare, I would like to mention the social endeavour of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, I was told by some of our party workers that a few young doctors in the town set up camps offering free treatment for the underprivileged.
Every month, hundreds of poor patients are benefitting from these camps.
The dedication of these doctor friends engaged in selfless service is truly worthy of praise.
Today, I’m saying it with pride that it was collective efforts that made the ‘Swachch Bharat Mission’ a successful campaign.

Whenever I get the opportunity, I visit the better India website and try to know more about such shining, inspiring deeds.
I am glad to observe that these days, there are many websites apprising us of inspiring life- stories of such remarkable gems.
Just as thepoitiveindia.com is doing great work in spreading positivity and infusing more sensitivity into society.

After that, she wrapped a cloth around the medal & kept it in a bag.
According to Rajani, her father has sacrificed a lot, undergone hardships to help her reach where she is.
Early every morning, Jasmer Singh used to leave for work before Rajani and her siblings woke up.
When Rajani approached her father, expressing her wish to learn boxing, he encouraged her, arranging for whatever possible resources that he could.
Rajani had to start her training in boxing with old gloves, since those days, the family was not too well, financially.
Despite so many hurdles, Rajani did not lose heart & went ahead with her training in boxing.
She has won a medal in Serbia too.
This very month, 20 year old Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune became the fastest Asian to traverse the globe riding a bicycle.

Don’t news of such achievements, such accomplishments inspire us?
Especially my young friends, when we hear about such feats, we derive inspiration to touch heights despite obstacles.
If your resolve is strong, if your fervor, your enthusiasm is without bounds, all your hurdles halt in their tracks.
Hardships can never turn into obstacles.
Somewhere the skies dotted with colourful flying kites, elsewhere the funfilled air of a mela or carnival.

Highlights:
1. The present system of Pay Bands and Grade Pay has been dispensed with and a new Pay Matrix as recommended by the Commission has been approved.

Starting salary of a newly recruited employee at lowest level will now be Rs. 18000 whereas for a freshly recruited Class I officer, it will be Rs. 56100.

Today’s dawn has brought a new spirit, a new enthusiasm, a new zeal and a new energy with it.
My dear countrymen, in our country, there is a Neelakurinji flower which blooms once every 12 years.
This year, Neelakurinji is in full bloom on the hills of Southern Nilgiri like the Ashok Chakra (the wheel of Ashoka) in the Tricolour on our Independence Day.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating this festival of independence at a time when the Mount Everest has been conquered many times; several brave-hearts and many of our daughters have unfurled the Tricolour atop the Mount Everest.
However, during this festival of independence, I will remember our young tribal children from remote forest areas, who have unfurled the Tricolour on the Mount Everest, further enhancing its glory.
Displaying utmost sensitivity and alertness, our Parliament has made the social justice framework stronger to protect the interests of the weaker sections of society – be it a Dalit, a deprived or exploited person or women.
The demand to confer constitutional status on the OBC Commission had existed for years.
This time, our Parliament has accorded Constitutional status to this Commission, and in doing so, has made an efforts to protect the interests of the Backward and the Most Backward classes.
Today, we are celebrating the festival of independence at a time when news reports have brought in a new consciousness in the country.
Today, every Indian, living in any nook and corner of the world, takes pride in the fact that India has become the sixth largest economy of the world.
We are celebrating this Independence Day in a positive atmosphere amidst such positive chain of events.
Today on behalf of my countrymen, I pay homage to those brave freedom fighters and salute them from the bottom of my heart.
Our soldiers and Paramilitary forces lay down their lives to uphold the dignity of the tricolour that inspires us to hold our heads high through life and death.
Our Police forces serve the country day and night to provide safety and security to the people.
I want to reassure the people who have lost their loved ones and are in distress, that the country is with them in their hour of crisis to help them overcome this difficult situation.
I share the grief of those who have lost their near and dear ones in this natural calamity.
Our masses had sacrificed their lives for the country’s freedom at a time when atrocities had crossed all limits.
The Jallianwallah Bagh incident reminds us of the sacrifices made by the brave hearts and is an inspiration to us.
I salute all the brave people from the depths of my heart.
Under the leadership of Bapu and the revolutionaries, many heroes, many satyagrahis, brave men and women and youth participated in the freedom struggle of the country.
Many years ago, the national poet from Tamil Nadu, Subramaniam Bharti translated his vision of the country into words
What was the dream that he envisioned after Independence?
Subramania Bharti said that India will show the way for the entire world to break free from every form of bondage.
This inclusive Constitution is the harbinger of a resolve to build a New India.
It has brought with it some responsibilities for us and has also set a few boundaries on us.
We aspire for an India that is strong and self-reliant, a nation that maintains a steady pace of progress, an India that keeps scaling new heights; an India that enjoys goodwill in the world.
Not only this, we want that India should also shine in the world – we want to build such an India.
My dear countrymen, I have shared my vision for TEAM INDIA earlier too.
When 125 crore countrymen become partners, then each and every citizen joins us in the progress of the country.
When 125 crore dreams, 125 crore resolves, 125 crore efforts, move in the right direction to attain desired goals then nothing is unattainable.
He said something very pertinent – What is Nation?
The Nation is a repository of a great force manifested through many organized units to give it a concrete shape.
It is this thought of Sri Aurobindo which is uniting the country and taking it ahead.
That we are actually moving ahead is difficult to comprehend unless we know from where we started.
If we don’t look at from where we began our journey, it will not be possible to assess how far we have come.
Precisely for this reason, if we consider 2013 as the base year and take into consideration the work that has been done in the last four years, you will be surprised to see the speed at which the country is moving and the pace at which the progress is being made.
Take the case of toilets.
If we had continued with the same speed of constructing toilets as in 2013, then to achieve 100% target would have taken decades.
If we talk about providing electricity to villages on the basis of work done in 2013, it would have taken a couple of more decades to accomplish this work.
If we talk about providing smoke free LPG gas connection to the poor and to the poor mothers, at the rate in which it was done in 2013, it could not have been completed even in a 100 years.
If we had maintained the speed of 2013 in laying optical fibre network in villages, then we would not have been able to accomplish the task for generations together.
We will strive to maintain the same pace of development.
Brothers and sisters, the country has huge expectations, the country has a lot of requirements and to fulfill those, it is imperative for the central government and the state governments to work together steadily and continuously.
However, the country has been experiencing change for the last four years.
The construction of new houses has gone up four times in the villages.
Toilets are being built in schools; new IIMs, new IITs and new AIIMS are being established.
I hail from Gujarat.
However, for that, one has to strive hard and be answerable.
But if the aims are not big, targets are not far-sighted, decisions are also not taken.
Development comes to a halt.
That is why my dear brothers and sisters, it is necessary for us to move ahead with big aims and resolve.
When targets are vague, when the spirit is not strong, then important decisions in our social life also get held up for years.
We took a bold decision of giving the farmers the MSP which is one and half times their investment.
Why was the Benami property law not enforced earlier?
The Benami property laws are implemented only when there is courage and a determination to do something for the country.
The Jawans of our defence forces were demanding one-rank one-pension for several decades.
They were not resorting to agitation because they are disciplined, but nobody was paying heed to their voices.
How have things changed?
We have reached the 100th spot in Ease of Doing Business ranking.
Today, the entire world is looking at this achievement with pride.
There was a time when the world perceived India as a country with ‘policy paralysis’ and ‘delayed reforms’.
Old newspaper clippings confirm this view.
India’s voice is being heard in every organization of which she is a member.
India is playing a crucial role in shaping up the discourse and providing leadership to these organizations.
We are raising our voice at international fora.
My dear countrymen, for years, we waited seeking membership to some international organizations, but today, our country has become a member of innumerable organizations.
Today, India offers a ray of hope for those who are concerned with environmental issues and global warming.
Today, every country of the world is keen to welcome any Indian stepping on its soil.
A new consciousness is visible in their eyes, when they look at an Indian.
The strength of the Indian passport has multiplied manifold.
This has instilled a new self-confidence, fresh energy and a resolve in every Indian to move ahead with new hope.
My dear countrymen, if an Indian is in trouble or distress in any part of the world, he can rest assured that his country is with him at every step.
Several recent incidents bear testimony to this fact.
However, today my dear brothers and sisters, North-East is coming up with positive and inspiring stories.
North-East today is shining in the field of sports.
My dear brothers and sisters, today we are receiving news from North-East that the last village has been electrified and the entire village danced the whole night.
We are hearing more such news from the North East about highways, railways, airways, waterways and information ways (i-ways) coming to the region.
The work of installing electric transmission lines across the North-East is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today, new educational institutions are being set up and the North-East India is becoming the new hub for organic farming.
North-East is going to host the Sports University.
Brothers and sisters, there was a time when the North-East used to feel that Delhi is very distant.
Within four years, we have brought Delhi to the doorsteps of North-East.
Our country’s youngsters have completely transformed the meaning of all standards of the economy.
They have infused new colours to the country’s standard of progress.
The youth of our country has completely transformed the nature of jobs.
Today the youngsters of the country are taking the nation to greater heights by exploring and engaging in new fields such as Start-ups, BPOs, E-commerce, mobility etc.
My dear countrymen, 13 crore Mudra Loans has been a major achievement.
This in itself is a great example of the changing ecosystem.
In an endeavor to realize the dream of Digital India, several Common Service Centres are being managed by young girls and boys in more than 3 lakhs villages today.
These centres are rendering “on-the-click global connect”/”anytime-anywhere connectivity” services to every citizen in the villages with the optimal utilization of Information Technology.
Brothers and Sisters, scientists of our nation have also left no stone unturned in bringing immense glory to our country.
In the global context, as well as fulfilling the requirements of the country, it is a matter of great pride that our scientists launched more than 100 satellites in one go leaving the world astonished.
That’s the capability of Indian scientists which has made the world stand up and applaud.
Successful launch of Mangalyaan in the very first attempt itself stands as testimony to the expertise and endeavors of our scientists.
This feat of successful in orbit launch of Mangalyaan speaks volumes about the capabilities of our scientists.
My dear countrymen, today from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I am delighted to share a good news.
Our country is undoubtedly progressing fast in its space missions.
With Mangalyaan our scientists have proved their capabilities.
Today our warehouses are filled with food grains.
I sincerely acknowledge the role of our agricultural scientists, cultivators and farmers in successfully steering the green revolution across decades.
But my brothers and sisters, times have changed now.
Our farmers and the agricultural markets have to face global challenges and competition.
So in order to realize this promise by 75th year of Independence, we want to move along with the farmers in that direction by bringing modernity and diversity in agricultural sector.
We want to bring value addition right from seeds to marketing.
For the first time we are moving towards agriculture export policy so that our farmers can also face global competition with confidence.
It is a matter of great satisfaction that today our country is the second highest fish producer in the world and is on the verge of reaching the top position soon.
The sugarcane farmers are happy that ethanol production has tripled.
It means, in rural economy other businesses allied to agriculture are also as important as agriculture.
We are developing village resources by spending crores of rupees through women self help groups.
I want to humbly submit that the sale of khadi products since independence has doubled.
This has generated employment for the poor.
My brothers and sisters, the farmers of my country are emphasizing on solar farming now.
Apart from farming, they can earn money by selling power generated through solar farming.
The people who spin charkha, the people who are associated with handloom are also earning their livelihood.
My dear brothers and sisters, economic development in our country is important, but more than anything else, human dignity is supreme.
Without human dignity, no country can move forward in a balanced way.
So to protect human dignity, we have to move ahead with those schemes which will ensure respectable lives for people.
The policies, traditions and intentions should be such that ordinary people, including the poorest of the poor can get a chance to live with equal dignity.
So we have provided gas connection to the poor through Ujjawala Yojana.
We have provided electricity to the poor through Saubhagya Yojana.
We are emphasizing on moving ahead with the concept of ‘Shrameva Jayate’.
Only yesterday, we heard the President’s address to the nation.
He described in great detail the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan.
Whenever, there is talk about Government, it is said that policies are framed but there is no last mile delivery.
The President described well how this campaign that was launched in Delhi has now spread to 65000 villages in aspirational districts, to the huts of the poor; how it is working in the backward villages.
My dear countrymen, when I talked about cleanliness from the Ramparts of Red Fort in 2014, some people made fun.
Some of them even said the Government had many things to do, why is it wasting its energy on an issue like cleanliness.
The credit for saving lives of three lakh children goes to every Indian who was a part of this campaign.
Bapu during his lifetime attached greater importance to cleanliness than even to freedom.
He used to say we got our freedom because of Satyagrahisand Swachchata (cleanliness) will come from Swachchagrahis.
Gandhiji trained Satyagrahis and this inspired us to prepare Swachchagrahis.
In the coming days, when we will be celebrating his 150th Birth Anniversary, crores of Swachchagrahis will offer Karyanjali (offerings of work) in the memory of Bapu.
In a way, they will fulfil his dreams which we are realizing now.
My Brothers and Sisters, it is true that because of cleanliness, lives of three lakh children have been saved.
But no matter how happy a middle class family is and how well-to-do it is or how poor it is, once a family member falls sick, the whole family suffers.
On occasions generations are afflicted with illnesses.
The Government of India has decided to launch Pradhanmantri Jan Arogya Abhiyan so that the poor man, the common man gets free treatment for serious diseases and he can be admitted to big hospitals free of cost.
Over the next four, five, six weeks from today, this technology will be tested across the country to make it fool proof.
Nor he would have to borrow money from a moneylender paying interest.
His family will not be destroyed.
And it will also open new avenues of employment for the youth, for the middle class families in the health sector.
New hospitals will be built in the tier-2 and tier-3 cities.
A lot of employment opportunities will also be generated.
Brothers and sisters, no poor person wants to lead a life of penury.
No poor person wants to die poor.
No poor person wants to pass on his poverty as a legacy to his children.
Throughout his life, he struggles to come out of poverty.
There is only one way to end this problem- through the empowerment of poor people.
In the last four years, we have laid emphasis on empowerment of poor people.
It has been our endeavour to empower the poor people.
An international organization has released a very good report in the recent past.
According to the report, five crore poor people in India have crossed the Poverty Line in the last two years.
Brothers and sisters, we have formulated several schemes for empowerment of the poor.
Although many schemes have been formulated in the past, middlemen, the people who take cuts, used to take away the cream of the scheme.
The poor people didn’t get what rightfully belonged to them.
Money was being paid from the exchequer, the schemes existed on paper, and the country continued to be robbed.
Brothers and sisters, therefore it is extremely essential to create confidence in the minds of the common man by eliminating the deformities in our system.
And whether it is the state governments or the centre or whether these are the local bodies of self-rule, we all have to work together.
And we will have to take it forward.
You will be surprised to know that since the time we have been engaged in this campaign for cleansing the system, and plugging leakages; there were six crore bogus beneficiaries who had never been born, who never existed on the earth but the money was being sent in their names – somebody was the beneficiary of Ujjwala Scheme, some beneficiary of the gas connection scheme with a duplicate gas connection; somebody was taking benefits through bogus ration cards; somebody was the beneficiary of scholarship scheme; someone else was the beneficiary of pension scheme.
This government has put an end to it.
We have taken steps in the direction of curbing corruption and putting an end to the entire system of black money.
Brothers and sisters, what are the consequences of it?
You must be aware of the fact that wheat is sold at Rs. 24-25 (per kilo) in the market, but the government provides it to the poor at only Rs.2 on ration card after buying it at Rs.24-25.
Similarly, rice which is sold at Rs.30-32 in the market is purchased by the Government at this rate and provided to the poor at Rs.3 on ration cards.
This means if anyone steals 1 kg of wheat on a bogus ration card, he automatically gains Rs.20-25.
If gets rice in this manner, he will get Rs 30-35.
That’s why this entire business of bogus names and IDs had been going on.
When a poor person used to approach the shop with his ration card and request grain, the shopkeeper would say that the stock was over.
That grain then used to be diverted to another shop and the poor had to purchase the grain of Rs.2 from the other shop at Rs.20-25.
The right of the poor used to be snatched away.
Therefore, this bogus system has now been uprooted.
Brothers and sisters, crores of poor people in our country get food at Rs.2 and Rs.3.
The government is spending generously for the same but the credit does not go to the government.
Today I want to specifically tell the honest taxpayers that when you have your food with your family, for a moment kindly ponder over what I am about to say.
I want to touch the hearts of the honest taxpayers.
I want to salute them.
I want to reassure the honest taxpayers that all the schemes that are in operation are run by your money.
The honest tax payers gain good fortune because the poor get to eat from the taxpayers’ money.
Therefore, it is the result of your honest paying of taxes when you have your meal with your family, 3 poor families are also able to have their meals at the same time.
Friends, an atmosphere of non-payment of taxes was being created.
Now, it is in force only in a few districts.
Left Wing Extremism, Maoism have been bleeding the country.
We want to move ahead on that road.
We do not want to move on the road of bullets and abuses, we want to move ahead with love and affection with the Kashmiri people who have stood with us in patriotic fervor.
Brothers and Sisters, irrigation schemes are progressing.
The work of building IIT, IIM and AIIMS is speedily going on.
The work of reclamation of Dal Lake is also going on.
The biggest thing is that during the past one year village headmen from Jammu and Kashmir in large numbers have been meeting me with the request to hold Panchayat elections there.
The elections could not be held for some reason or the other.
I am happy that the villagers of Jammu and Kashmir will have this opportunity in the coming months.
A system in which villagers will be able to look after their villages will be in place soon.
Now, the Government of India gives huge funds which go directly to the villages and this will help the village headmen to take their villages on the path of development.
That is why we are moving forward in the direction of holding Panchayat elections and election to City Councils.
Brothers and Sisters, we have to take the country to new heights.
Our motto is “Sab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikaas’.
There is no discrimination based on yours or mine and no nepotism.
Let every Indian have a house of his own – Housing for All.
Every house should have electricity connection, power for all.
Every Indian should have toilets and therefore Sanitation for All.
Every Indian should be skilled, so Skill for All.
Every Indian should get good and affordable health services, so Health for All.
My dear countrymen, I am worked up and I am restless because malnutrition has been a major hurdle in the development of the children of our country.

I am restless to rid my country of malnutrition.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar,
Tomorrow, 29th August is the birth anniversary of hockey wizard Dhyan Chand.
This occasion is celebrated as ‘National Sports Day’ throughout the country.
I offer my tributes to Dhyan Chand ji and wish to remind you all about his invaluable contribution.
He had complimented Dhyan Chand ji by saying that ‘he scores goals like runs’.
Dhyan Chand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and nationalism.
During a match in Kolkata one player from the opposite team hit him on the head with the hockey stick.
At that point, only 10 minutes were left in the game.
And, Dhyan Chand ji scored three goals in just those ten minutes and said – “I avenged the hit by scoring goals”.
Dear countrymen, as the time of Mann Ki Baat draws near, a very large number of suggestions are received on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
These are on diverse topics.
But, I saw that this time in most of these suggestions, people had asked me to say something about the Rio Olympics.
I find it a very positive sign that our common people have such attachment and awareness about Rio Olympics and they are insisting that the Prime Minister of the country says something on this matter.
Whatever medals we got have been earned by our daughters.
These Betis have once again proved that they are second to none in any respect.
One of these daughters is from North India while there is one who belongs to South India and then there is one from the Eastern part.
All in all, they represent all corners of our country.
It seems that our daughters in the whole of India have decided to take up the responsibility of bringing glory to the nation.
Shikhar Thakur has written on MyGov that we could have performed better at the Olympics.
He has written – “Respected Modi Sir, first of all, congratulations on our winning two medals at Rio.
However, I want to draw your attention to the question – was our performance really good?
And, the answer is ‘No’.
We have to go a long way in the field of sports.
Our parents, even today, insist on focusing on studies and academics.
Sports are considered a waste of time in our society.
We need to change this mindset.
Society needs motivation for this.
And, no one can do this better than you.”
Thousands of people have expressed similar sentiments.
There is no denying the fact that we could not perform up to the expectations.
However, it is also a fact that if we look closely, we shall find that despite missing medals, Indian players gave a very good account of themselves for the first time in some of the events.
See, our Abhinav Bindra very narrowly missed the medal and got fourth place in Shooting.
Dipa Karmakar produced a superb performance in Gymnastics, although she remained at the fourth place and missed a Bronze by a very narrow margin.
After 32 years of P.T. Usha’s feat, Lalita babar qualified for the finals in track and field.
Our Women’s Hockey Team qualified for the Olympic Games after a space of 36 long years.
Many players like Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das gave a very good performance.
But my dear countrymen, we do have to go a long way.
And if we stick to the same routine, we may perhaps keep facing the same disappointment.
We shall prepare a roadmap on how we can do better.
We have to prepare a far reaching plan keeping in view the Olympics in 2020, 2024, 2028.
I urge the State Governments also to set up similar committees to find out as to what we can do in sports.
I urge our sports associations also to do objective and impartial brainstorming on this.
In our life, a teacher holds the same place which a mother does.
These days, after Rio Olympics, Pulela Gopi Chand ji is being talked about everywhere.
He is a player first but he has set up a glorious example of what a good coach, that is, a teacher should be.
I see Gopi Chand ji today as an excellent teacher besides being a very accomplished player.
And, on Teachers Day, I salute Pulela Gopi Chand ji for his hard work, his dedication towards sports and his manner of finding happiness in the success of his disciples.
We always feel the contribution of our teachers in our lives.
5th September happens to be the birthday of India’s former President Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates this as Teachers Day.
However, I can happily say that even now I receive a hand written letter every month from one of my teachers, who has turned 90 now.
In this letter, he mentions books read by him during that month along with quotations.
He also gives his comments on what he deems correct or otherwise in whatever I have done during the month.
It is as if he is, even now, teaching me in the class room.
In a way, he is conducting a correspondence course for me even today.
And, about his handwriting even at the age of 90, I marvel that he writes so beautifully whereas my own handwriting is very poor.
That is why, whenever I look at somebody’s good handwriting, I have a great respect for it.
You may also be having similar experience.
If you have a photograph with your teacher or an incident connected with your teacher or an inspirational thing associated with your teacher, please do share the same on NarendraModiApp.
Looking at the contribution of teachers in the country from the point of view of students is also immensely valuable in itself.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Utsav is drawing near.
Ganesh ji removes all obstacles and let us all wish that our country, our society, our families, and each one of us may lead a life free of obstacles.
But, when we mention Ganesh Utsav, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public celebration of Ganesh Utsav is Lokmanya Tilak’s gift to us.
By publicly celebrating Ganesh Utsav, he turned this religious occasion into a festival of national awakening and social refinement.
These Ganesh festivities included holding wide-ranging discussions on the issues that touched our lives and society, and comprised such programmes which provided a new vigour and vitality to our social fabric.
Young people make elaborate preparations, they are full of vigour.
Some people even now try to follow the path shown by Lokmanya Tilak ji.
They organise debates on topics of public interest, and hold essay competitions and rangoli competitions.
Tableus depict the issues of social concern in a very artistic manner.
In a way, a mass campaign of public education gets underway through these Ganesh festivities.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us the inspirational mantra – “Swaraj, that is, freedom is our birthright.”
But now we live in independent India.
Come on, I invite you all.
It is true that festivals express the vitality of a society.
Festivals infuse new life into individuals as well as the society.
I have seen that this time, many people have written to me mentioning Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
They are worried about environment.
POP idols are not environment friendly”.
He has expressed a great pain, others have also.
Ganesh ji removes obstacles.
So, we should not make such Ganeshji idols, which create problems.
If we resolve now, our efforts will lead to employment generation for those families which traditionally used to make clay idols in the past.
Mother Teresa devoted her entire life to the service of the poor in India.
We keep learning something or the other from great men and women, saints, sages, holy people.
We shall continue to receive something, learn something from them and keep on doing some good things.
Peoples’ power is, in a way, considered to be a divine incarnation.
Government of India has made a successful effort to clean the Ganga and involve the people for this project with the cooperation of five State governments.
I also congratulate all those Ministries of the Government of India and also those ministers who turned this vision into reality.
I also want to thank the Chief Ministers of these five States for taking the vital step in the direction of making Ganga clean by involving people’s power.
My dear countrymen, certain things touch me very deeply and my heart bows in respect to those who visualize such heartwarming initiatives.
In Kabirdham district of Chhatisgarh more than 1.25 lakh students from about 1700 schools collectively wrote letters to their parents.
Some students even wrote that they would rather go without celebrating birthday but the toilet must be constructed.
Students of age between seven to seventeen took up this task.
And this had such an impact, such an emotional impact that while the students were going to school the next day, their parents handed over reply letters to them addressed to the teacher in which they promised to build toilets by a certain date positively.
This is what inspires us.
In Koppal district of Karnataka, a sixteen year old girl Mallamma started a Satyagrah against her own family.
Just see the power and strength in Mallamma’s protest, and also consider the grand gesture of a village Pradhan like Mohammad Shafi.
Look how the solutions to problems are found, this is the power of the people.
My dear countrymen, Swachha Bharat has become the dream of each Indian.
Some Indians have made it their resolve.
Some Indians have made it their aim and purpose.
But, each one is connected to it in one or the other way and everyone is making a contribution.
Daily we hear about the various innovative efforts in this direction.
You can find details of this plan on website.
A competition will be held and the winners will be awarded prizes on Gandhi Jayanti Day on 2nd October.
I request TV channels also to invite such films and hold a competition.
I call upon you all to come forward and participate.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried its best to have close, cordial and vibrant relations with its neighbours.
Now, some people may wonder whether Honourable President should inaugurate a Radio Channel?
But this is no ordinary Radio Channel, it is a very big and very important step.
We have Bangladesh as our neighbour.
We know that both Bangladesh and West Bengal continue to have a common cultural heritage.
So, Akashvani Maitree on this side and Bangladesh Betaar on that side will mutually share the content and Bengali speaking people on both sides will enjoy the programmes of Akashvani, that is, All India Radio.
This people to people contact is a big contribution of Akashvani.
The President launched this radio channel.
I extend my thanks to Bangladesh also for collaborating with us in this initiative.
I congratulate the friends in All India Radio too for making their contribution in our foreign policy also.
My dear countrymen, although you have entrusted me with the responsibilities of Prime Minister but I also am a human being just like you.
At times, sensitive events touch me a little too deeply.
Such sentimental incidents generate new energy, give new inspiration and this is what motivates us Indians to do some remarkable things.
If she had not forbidden me from revealing her name, I from the core of my heart wanted to announce her name while talking to you.
And, she has said that a letter from the Prime Minister was no less than a Padma Shree honour for her.
Dear countrymen, you may be knowing that I have tried to send a letter, to be delivered personally through my representatives, to all those who surrendered their cooking gas subsidy on my appeal.
My effort is to send letters to more than one crore people.
You may well imagine the missionary spirit of this retired teacher living on pension and donating an amount of fifty thousand rupees for the sake of provision of gas connection to the other poor mothers and sisters, in order to save them from the ill effects of Chulha smoke.
And, she did not write to me this letter as a Prime Minister but she straightforwardly wrote – “Modi Bhaiya!”
Yet, even amidst the reports of these floods, some such events happened which should be remembered.
In August 2016, about 90 political parties in the country, many of these parties in the Parliament, which were staunch opponents of each other and which do not miss the slightest opportunity against each other, all these parties got united and passed the GST Act.
The credit for this goes to all the parties.
And, this is an example which shows that great tasks can be accomplished by working in unison to move ahead.
And, we all are of the view, and this is the view of all 125 crore Indians, right from the village Pradhan to the Prime Minister that every loss of life in Kashmir – whether it is of a young man or of a security personnel – it is our own loss, a loss of our people, a loss for the nation!
Those trying to disturb peace in Kashmir by putting small children in the front and hiding behind them will have to be answerable to these very innocent children some day.
My dear countrymen, ours is a vast nation, full of diversities.
To keep this country of manifold diversities united, we all as citizens, as society and as the government, have a responsibility to encourage things which strengthen our national unity and highlight these with full vigour, only then we can make our country’s future bright, and, of course, this will be achieved.
I have full faith in the power of my 125 crore countrymen.
The activities between the two sides will start after the receipt of copy of the signed MoC.
The MoC, will enhance bilateral cooperation between the two countries in the areas of Traditional Systems of Medicine.
This will be of immense importance to both countries.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today laid the foundation stone for Vanijya Bhawan, a new office complex for the Union Government’s Department of Commerce, at New Delhi.
The Prime Minister expressed confidence that the building will be completed well within the stipulated time.
He emphasized that this would be in keeping with the spirit of New India, and moving away from old practices, under which important building projects, even in the Capital, had been inordinately delayed.
In this context, he mentioned the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre, the Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial, the Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra and the new office building for the Central Information Commission.
He said that this is also the result of breaking silos within the working of the Government.
He hoped that the new office building – Vanijya Bhawan – would further facilitate elimination of silos in India’s commerce sector.
Speaking about the country’s demographic dividend, the Prime Minister said that it is our collective responsibility to fulfil the aspirations of our youth.
Talking of adoption of digital technology, the Prime Minister remarked that the land on which the new building is being constructed, was earlier occupied by the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposal.
This has now been replaced by the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), which has seen transactions worth Rs. 8700 crore in a short time, he added.
He also spoke of the benefits of GST, and said the Union Government is making constant efforts to create a people-friendly, development-friendly and investment-friendly environment.

He said the Department of Commerce must resolve to raise India’s share in total global exports to at least 3.4 percent, from the current 1.6 percent.
Similarly he said, efforts must be made to raise domestic manufacturing output, to reduce imports.
In this context, he gave the example of electronics manufacturing.

These projects include the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor, and the Char Dham Mahamarg Vikas Pariyojna.
The Prime Minister reviewed the progress in implementation of the AMRUT Mission.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has paid tributes to the Indian soldiers who fought in the First World War.
India remembers our brave soldiers who fought in WW-1.
This was a war in which India was not directly involved yet our soldiers fought world over, just for the cause of peace.
It is but natural for us to solemnly remember SardarVallabhbhai Patel as we exalt the spirit of unity that binds our Nation, our Mother India.
The 31st of October this year will be special on one more account- on this day, we shall dedicate the statue of unity of the nation as a true tribute to Sardar Patel.
Erected on the banks of river Narmada in Gujarat, the structure is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty.
This is the world’s tallest scyscraping statue.
Every Indian will now be proud to see the world’s tallest statue here on Indian soil.
Sardar Patel, a true son of the soil will adorn our skies too.
I am sure this will turn out to be a described destination for one & all across the country.
My dear brothers & sisters, we celebrated ‘Infantry Day’ yesterday.
I respectfully bow before all of them who are part of the Indian Armed Forces.
I also salute the families of our soldiers.
But, do you know why we Indian citizens commemorate this day as Infantry Day?
This is the very day when Indian Forces landed in Kashmir and saved the valley from the clutches of aggression.
This incident too is directly related to SardarVallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview with the celebrated Army officer samManekshaw.
In that interview, field Marshal Sam Manekshaw was reminiscing on times when he was a Colonel.
Around this time, military operations commenced in Kashmir.
And immediately after that, our troops flew to Kashmir… we’ve seen how our Army was successful.
The 31st of October also is the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
Our respectful tributes to Indira ji too.
My dear countrymen, who doesn’t love sports?
If the youth of a country possess these qualities, that country will progress not only in areas such as Economy and Science & Technology but also bring laurels home in the field of sports.
Just recently I had two memorable meetings.
First, I got an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held at Jakarta.
These athletes bagged a tally of 72 medals, creating a new, unprecedented record, bringing glory to the nation.
Their grit & determination; their resolve to overcome all odds in the path of success is indeed inspiring for all our countrymen.
Similarly, I was blessed with a chance to meet our winners of the Summer youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
You will be pleased to know that in the Summer Youth Olympics 2018, the performance of our youth was the best ever.
At this event we won 13 medals besides 3 in mixed events.
You may recall that even, in the recent Asian Games, India’s performance was par excellence.
Have you observed the way I have frequently used terms such as ‘the best ever’ or ‘new, unprecedented record’?
This is the real story of Indian Sports which are witnessing an upswing with each passing day.
India is setting new records not just in the field of sports but also in hitherto uncharted areas.
To give you an example, I would like to mention about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur, who won a gold medal for the country in the 2018 Para Asian Games.
He is a Divyang by birth.
When he turned eight he lost his father.
Then he spent another eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he eked out a living cleaning DTC buses and working as waiter at roadside eateries.
The same Narayan is winning medals for India at International events.
16 year old player Tabaabi Devi hails from a village in Manipur.
Her father is a labourer and mother a fish-seller.
There were times when the family had no money to buy food.
Even such hardships were not able to cow down her zest & devotion.
And she has created history by winning a medal for the country.
Every young sportsperson’s passion & dedication is the hallmark of New India.
My dear countrymen, you may recall that we had successfully organized FIFA Under- 17 World Cup in the year2017.
The whole world acclaimed this as a very successful tournament.
FIFA Under -17 World Cup had created a record in terms of the number of viewers on the ground.
More than 12 lakh enthusiasts enjoyed the romance of Football matches in various stadia across the country and boosted the morale of the young players.
This year also, we have been fortunate to be the hosts of the Men’s Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneshwar.
The Hockey World Cup will commence on the 28th November to be concluded on the 16th December.
Each Indian who plays any game or has interest in any game has a definite interest in Hockey.
India has a golden history in Hockey.
India has won gold medals in various tournaments and has been the World Champion once.
India has produced many great hockey players.
Wheneverthere will be reference to Hockey,the story will remain incomplete without a mention of these legends.
Hockey maestro Major Dhyan Chand is a renowned name all over the world.
Then, from Balbeer Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhan Raj Pillai, Indian Hockey has had a very long journey.
Even today, players of Team India are encouraging the younger generation through their hard work and focused attention.
It is a good chance for the sport lovers to witness closely contested matches.
Go to Bhubaneshwar and cheer up the Indian team and also encourage each team there.
Odisha has a dignified historical background and has a very rich cultural tradition.
People of the state are full of warmth.
This is a chance for the sports lovers to see Odisha.
They can visit the world famous holy places like the Sun Temple of Konark, Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri and Chilka Lake along with enjoying the games there.
I also convey my wishes to all the teams from around the world coming to participate in the tournament.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward and volunteering for social works is really inspirational and encouraging for all our countrymen.
But, in this new era, the new generation is coming forward in a new way with a fresh vigour and spirit to fulfill their new dream.
Recently, I attended a programme where a portal was launched, its name is ‘Self 4 Society’, MyGov and the IT and Electronics industry of the country have launched this portal with a view to motivating their employees for social activities and providing them with opportunities to perform in this field.
Their dedication and vigour can make each Indian feel proud.
A fresh and pleasant air of IT to society, We-not I, a transformation from the individual to the community is imbibed in this.
One young person learned to play wheelchair basket ball in order to be able to help the wheelchair basket ball team of differently abled, divyang players.
Will this not make every Indian feel proud.
This spirit of ‘We, not I’ will surely inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I was going through your suggestion for Mann Ki Baat this time, I found a very interesting comment from Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pudducherry.
He wrote on Mygov- Please take up the topic “in Mann Ki Baat” as to how the tribes and their traditions and rituals are the best examples of coexistence with the nature.
Our country is also facing this problem.
But, for its solution we only have to look inwards, to look into our glorious past and our rich traditions and have especially to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
To live in consonance and closed coordination with the nature has been an integral part of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brethren worship trees and plants and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The Bhil tribes of Central India and specially those in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship Peepal and Arjun trees religiously.
TheBishnoi community in the desert land of Rajasthan has shown us a way of environment protection.
Specially, in the context of serving trees, they prefer laying down their lives but cannot tolerate any harm to a single tree.
The Gond tribes in Central Indai stop fishing in some parts of Kaithan river during the breeding season.
Tribal communities make their dwelling units from natural material which are strong as well as eco-friendly.
In the isolated regions of the Nilgiri plateau in South India, a small wanderer community Toda make their settlements using locally available material only.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a fact that the tribal community believes in very peaceful and harmonious co-existence but, if somebody tries to harm and cause damage to their natural resources, they do not shy away from fighting for their rights.
There is no wonder that our foremost freedom fighters were the brave people from our tribal communities.
Who can forget BhagwanBirsaMunda who struggled hard against the British Empire to save their own forest land.
Come on, let us express our gratitude towards them.
My dear countrymen, in “Mann Ki Baat”, we talk about those persons and institutions who make extra-ordinary contribution for the society.
These works may seem small but have a very deep impact in changing our thinking and in giving a new direction to the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about a farmer brother Gurbachan Singh from Punjab.
The son of this hard working farmer Gurbachan Singh ji was to be married.
Gurbachan Singh ji had told the bride’s parents that the marriage would be performed in a solemn manner.
But then he suddenly said that he had one condition.
And, when a condition is put these days, generally it is thought that the other side is going to make a big demand which will be really difficult for the bride’s family to fulfill.
But, you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurbachan Singh was a simple farmer and what he told the bride’s father and the condition he placed reflects the true strength of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji asked him to promise that they will not burn parali or stubble in their fields.
This point made by Gurbachan Singh ji appears quite ordinary but this reveals how tall and strong his personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society who connect their individual matters with the benefit of the society as a whole.
ShrimanGurbachan Singh ji’s family has presented one such example before us.
I have also read about a village KallarMajra which is near Nabha in Punjab.
KallarMajra came into lime light as the farmers there mix the stubble with the sand by ploughing their fields rather than burning the stubble and adopt the necessary technology for the process.
Congratulations to bhaiGurbachan Singh ji !
Congratulations to the people of KallarMajra and of all those places who are making their best efforts to keep the environment clean and pollution free.
All of you are carrying forward the Indian tradition of a healthy life style as a true successor.
Just as a sea is formed by collection of tiny drops, similarly,a small constructive step, plays a vital role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it has been told in our epics:-
For India, World War I was an important event.
Rightly speaking we had no direct connection with that war.
Despite this, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed it to the world that they are second to none if it comes to war.
Our soldiers have displayed great valour in difficult areas and adverse conditions.
There has just been a single objective behind it- Restoration of peace.
Development of the poorest of the poor is the real indicator of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-East has a unique distinction of its own.
The natural beauty of North –East has no parallel and the people of this area are extremely talented.
Now our North-east is also known for all best deeds.
North east is one region that has made grand progress in organic farming.
A few days ago Sikkim won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award, 2018 for encouraging the sustainable food system.
This award is given by the UN body ‘Food & Agriculture Organisation’ – FAO.
You will be delighted to know that this best policy making award is equivalent to an Oscar in the sector.
Not only this, our Sikkim outperformed 51 nominated policies of 25 countries to win this award.
For this, I heartily compliment the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, October is about to end.
Quite a change is being felt in the weather.
I extend my best wishes to all countrymen for these festivals.
I would request all of you to take best care of yourselves and take care of your health as well and also take care of social interests.
I am sure these festivals are an opportunity to make new resolves.
These festivals prove a chance to advance in a mission mode and to make firm resolves in your life.
Your progress is a vital part of the country’s progress.
The more you progress, the more will the country progress.
My best wishes to you all.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has expressed sadness and shock over the fire tragedy which happened at a temple in Kollam district of Kerala today morning.

Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy of the Republic of Korea;
Minister for Commerce & Industry, Government of India;
President and CEO of the Chosun-ilboGroup;
Business Leaders of Korea and India;
I am very happy to be here with you.
Such a large gathering of Korean companies in India is actually a global story.
I take this opportunity to welcome all of you to India.
We are also bound by our Buddhist traditions.
Our Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore composed a poem – ‘Lamp of the East’ – in 1929 about Korea’s glorious past and its bright future.
Bollywood films are also very popular in Korea.
And at the Pro-Kabaddi league in India a few months ago, some of the loudest cheers, were reserved for a Korean Kabaddi player.
From Princess to poetry and from Buddha to Bollywood; we have so much in common.
As I have mentioned earlier, I have always been fascinated by Korea.
I visited Korea when I was Chief Minister of Gujarat.
From IT and Electronics to Automobile and Steel, Korea has given exemplary products to the world.
Korean companies are appreciated for their innovation, and strong manufacturing capability.
It is heartening to note that our bilateral trade crossed 20 billion dollars last year, for the first time in six years.
However, South Korea ranks only 16th in FDI Equity inflows to India.
India offers a lot of potential for the Korean Investors with its huge market and enabling policy environment.
Since many of you are already present in India, you already know the ground realities.
Also, through your interaction with Indian CEOs, you must have already discovered the direction in which India is going.
However, let me take a few more minutes.
I would like to use this occasion to personally invite to India those who are not yet present here.
By Demand, I mean a big and growing market for goods and services.
A rising middle class is creating further growth in the domestic market.
We have worked towards creating a stable business environment, ensuring the rule of law, and removing arbitrariness in decision making.
We seek positivity in day to day transactions.
We are widening the areas of trust; rather than digging into doubts.
This represents a complete change of the Government’s mindset.
A shift from issuing authority to business partner to achieve ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’.
And when this happens, simplification of rules and procedures starts automatically.
We are on a de-regulation and de-licensing drive.
Validity period of industrial licenses has been increased from three years to fifteen years and more; The Industrial licensing regime for defense production has been liberalized greatly.
We have said that factory inspections will only be need-based and only on authorization of the higher authority.
In Dime are one of the most open countries now.
Most of the sectors of our economy are open for FDI.
More than 90 percent approvals have been put on automatic route.
There is practically no requirement of Government approval for investments in manufacturing sector except for Defense sector.
Incorporating a company along with allotment of statutory numbers is now just a one day affair.
We have carried out thousands of reforms on the business, investment, governance and cross border trading front.
FDI inflows have grown the most in the last three years.
There is a new energy and vibrancy in the domestic industry.
A new start up eco-system has been un-veiled.
With unique ID and mobile phone penetration, we are fast moving towards becoming a Digital Economy.
Our, strategy is to leverage the strength of hundreds of millions of Indians who have come online in recent years.
We moved up 19 places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of World Bank.
We have a vast pool of skilled professionals with knowledge and energy.
Now, we have a world class engineering education base and strong R&D facilities.
An informal economy into a formal economy, you can imagine the range and span of our work.
We are already the third-largest economy by purchasing power.
Very soon, we will become the world’s fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP.
Our vision is to create a globally competitive industry and services base equipped with skill, speed and scale.
Therefore, we are continuously working to improve our investment climate.
We particularly want to promote manufacturing in a big way to create jobs for our youth.
For this purpose, we have launched a campaign called “Make in India”.
This includes bringing our industrial infrastructure, policies and practices to best global standards and to convert India into a global manufacturing hub.
This initiative has been well supplemented by programmers like ‘Digital India’ and ‘Skill India’.
Cleaner and greener development and Zero defect Zero effect manufacturing is another commitment.
Your car making and our designing capabilities can be put together.
Though we have become the third biggest producer of steel, we need to add lot of value in it.
Your steel-making capacity and our resources of iron ore can be put together for better products.
Similarly, your ship-building capacity and our agenda of port led development can become a driver of our partnership.
Housing, smart cities, railway stations, water, transportation, railways, sea ports, energy including renewables, IT infrastructure and services, electronics, are all very promising sectors in my country.
India and Korea are major economies in the region.
I would like to conclude by saying that India is now ready for business.
I further assure you that whatever is required to promote and protect your investments will be done here.
Because we value your involvement and contribution in our economy.
At a personal level too, I assure you of my full support whenever required.

· Traditional skills will be recognized, nurtured and promoted through informal apprenticeships, under various programmes.
By 2025, almost 1 in 5 of the world’s working age population (18.3%) will be Indian.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, and the Prime Minister of Belgium, Mr. Charles Michel, today jointly carried out the remote technical activation of a 3.6 metre optical telescope located at Deosthal in Uttarakhand.
This is a state-of-the-art world class telescope, which will contribute to observations for several frontline scientific applications.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated, or laid the foundation stone of important projects, cumulatively worth over Rs. 900 crore, in Varanasi.
Among the projects inaugurated are the Varanasi City Gas Distribution Project, and the Varanasi-Ballia MEMU train.
The foundation stone was laid for the PanchkoshiParikrama Marg, and several projects under the Smart City Mission and NamaamiGange.
The Prime Minister also laid the Foundation Stone for an International Convention Centre in Varanasi.

He said a glimpse of this new Banaras is now visible all around.
He said significant investment has been made in Varanasi over the last four years.
He said that the projects worth nearly 1000 crore that were either inaugurated, or for which the Foundation Stone was laid today, is a part of this ongoing exercise.
The Prime Minister elaborated upon his vision of Transfornation through Transportation, and said the Foundation Stone of the Poorvanchal Expressway at Azamgarh today was part of the same exercise.
The Prime Minister said that Varanasi is emerging as a centre for medical science in the region.
He said BHU will work with AIIMS to develop a world class health institute.
He thanked the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr. Shinzo Abe, for this gift from Japan to the people of Varanasi.
He appreciated the initiatives taken by the people and the State Government of Uttar Pradesh for tourism, and under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Prime Minister mentioned the poor condition of roads and other infrastructure in Varanasi, four years ago.
He said the waste of the city was going unchecked into the River Ganga.
Today, he said, by contrast, efforts are underway to clean the Ganga from Gangotri till the ocean.
He spoke of the various projects for sewage treatment.
He said the fruits of all these efforts would become apparent in the future.
He asserted that work is in full swing for an Integrated Command and Control Centre, that would make Varanasi a Smart City.
He said the Smart City Initiative is not just a mission to improve infrastructure in cities, but also a mission to give India a new identity.

The Prime Minister said that the Government is working on gas grids, water grids, digital network, leveraging space technology, and using technology to help farmers.
My young friends have asked me many questions related to Science; they keep writing on quite a few points.
All of us have seen that the sea appears blue, but we know from routine life experiences that water has no colour at all.
Have we ever thought why water acquires colour in rivers and seas?
The same thought occurred to a young man in the 1920s.
The same question gave rise to a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about Science, the first name that strikes us is that of Bharat Ratna Sir C.V.Raman.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light scattering.
This land has given birth to many a great scientist.
On the one hand, there has been a tradition of great Mathematicians like Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupt and Aryabhatt; on the other, in the field of medicine, Sushrut & Charak have bestowed upon us a place of pride.
Right from Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargobind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose have brought laurels to India.
The famous particle BOSON has been named after Satyendranath Bose.
Recently I got an opportunity to take part in a programme in Mumbai – the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was interesting to know about the ongoing miraculous accomplishments in the field of Science.
Artificial Intelligence aids in making robots, Bots and other machines meant for specific tasks.
Through self learning, machines today can enhance their intelligence to a smarter level.
Can we make better predictions of natural disasters using Artificial Intelligence?
Can we use it to provide assistance to farmers on crop yield?
A few days ago, I got an opportunity to accompany the Prime Minister of Israel to Ahmedabad, Gujarat for the inauguration of ‘I create’.
I feel we can harness Artificial Intelligence in many such fields.
Science and Technology are value neutral.
They don’t possess any value in themselves.
Any machine will work the way we want it to.
It entirely depends on us what task we want it to perform.
Here human objectives assume significance; the use of Science for the sole purpose of human welfare, with the endeavour to assist human lives touch the greatest heights.
Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, failed many a time in his experiments.
Coincidentally, I am fortunate today to be in Auroville, the land, the karmabhoomi of Maharshi Arvind.
And this is the very essence, the real inspiration behind scientific inventions and discoveries.
Never rest till every ‘why’, ‘what’ & ‘how’ are answered.
I congratulate our scientists, and all those connected with Science on the occasion of National Science Day.
Since the 4th of March is National Safety Day, the Prime Minister should include safety in the Mann Ki Baat programme in order to raise awareness on safety.
When we refer to public safety, two aspects are very important- proactiveness and preparedness.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, if we are not able to attain a certain level, it will get extremely difficult during the time of disasters.
If we stay alert, abide by the prescribed rules & regulations, we shall not only be able to save our own lives but we can prevent catastrophes harming society.
There are times when we come across many slogans on safety at the work place but none following their letter and spirit.
I urge the fire brigade under corporations and municipalities to visit school children once a week or once a month and perform mock drills for them.
This will have a dual benefit – the fire brigade will undergo an exercise in readiness and the new generation will get lessons in alertness.
India is a land of geographic and climatic diversities.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority, NDMA is the vanguard when it comes to dealing with disasters in the country.
During earthquakes, floods, cyclones, landslides, NDMA reaches the area within no time.
They have issued guidelines; simultaneously they keep imparting training on a regular basis for capacity building.
In Districts prone to floods and cyclones, an initiative names ‘Aapada Mitra’ has been launched for training Volunteers.
Training and awareness have a very important role to play.
Two- three years ago, thousands of people would lose their lives every year due to heat-wave.
Mass participation led to good results.
In 2017, the death toll on account of heat wave remarkably came down to around 220 or so.
This proves that if we accord priority to safety, we can actually attain safety.
And there are numerous such unnamed, unsung heroes.
Our Fire & Rescue services, National Disaster Response Forces Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces… these brave hearts go beyond the call of duty to help people in distress, often risking their own lives.
Organisations like NCC and Scouts are also contributing in this task; they are getting trained too.
It was a novel humanitarian experiment on a large scale.
In our culture, we often talk of safety of values; we now need to realize the values of safety.
We’ll have to make it part of our life, our being.
In day to day life, during air travel, we must have frequently come across air hostesses giving out a rather longish speech, safety instructions at the beginning of a flight.
We must have heard it hundreds of times.
But today if one of us is taken inside an aircraft and asked about the location of equipments, say life jackets, and how to use them, I can say for sure that none of us will be able to give the right answer.
So, was there a provision for giving our information?
Was there a scope of direct visibility when the information was given?
But we did not respond actively.
Because by nature, we are not conscious.
And that is why our ears hear when we sit in the aircraft, but no one realizes that ‘these instructions are for me’.
We experience this in all walks of life.
Let us not think that safety is only meant for someone else.
If all of us become conscious and aware of our own safety, the essence of safety of society will be inbuilt.
My dear countrymen, in the current budget, emphasis has been laid on turning ‘waste to wealth’ and ‘waste to energy’ through Bio gas, under the Swachch Bharat Campaign.
An effort was initiated which was named GOBAR-Dhan – Galvanizing Organic Bio Agro Resources.
The aim of this GOBAR- DHAN scheme is ensuring cleanliness in villages and generating wealth and energy by converting cattle dung and solid agricultural waste into Compost and Bio Gas.
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other Bio-waste to produce energy.
But India was lacking full capacity utilization.
Under the Swachch Bharat Mission (Rural), we are taking rapid strides in this direction.
A target has been set to use cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste to produce Bio gas based energy.
Under the Gobardhan Scheme our farmer brothers & sisters in rural India will be encouraged to consider dung and other waste not just as a waste but as a source of income.
Under the aegis of ‘GobarDhanYojana’, many benefits will accrue to rural areas.
Biogas generation will increase self-reliance in energy utilized for cooking and lighting.
Farmers and cattle herders will be helped in augmenting their income.
There will be novel opportunities for newer jobs linked to waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc.
An online trading platform will be created for better implementation of ‘Gobar Dhan Yojana’, it will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers can get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially our sisters residing in rural India, to step forward, and through creation of self-help groups and cooperative societies extract full advantage from this opportunity.
My dear countrymen, till date, we have been hearing about the myriad types of festivals – be it music festivals, food festivals, film festivals and many other kinds of festivals.
But in a unique endeavor in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the state’s first ‘Trash Mahotsav’ was organized.
The objective behind this festival sponsored by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to generate awareness about cleanliness and the methods using which city’s waste can be creatively used and inculcate awareness about various ways to recycle the garbage.
A plethora of activities were organized during this festival, which found full participation of students and adults.
A festive atmosphere regarding cleanliness got geared up.
The way the school children took part in the entire endeavor was amazing.
For the innovative manner in which importance of waste management and cleanliness were displayed in this festival, I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the entire populace of Chhattisgarh, its government and administration.
Every year on March 8, ‘International Women’s Day’ is celebrated.
There are many programs that are held in our country and the world.
On this day, women are also felicitated with ‘Nari Shakti Puraskar’ who have performed exemplary tasks in different sectors in the past.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
Today, it is our duty to ensure the participation of women in every field of life, be it social or economic life, it is our fundamental duty.
Not only has she advanced herself but has carried forward the country and society to newer heights.
After all, our dream of ‘New India’ is the one where women are strong and empowered and are equal partners in the development of the country.
A few days ago, a gentleman had given me a very sound proposition.
Under the auspices of this campaign starting from January 26, 2018, these women constructed 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days and made a record of sorts.
You can imagine what a mammoth undertaking it was!
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is an integral component of ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’, which will change the course of the campaign of cleanliness in general life, the effective role of hygiene in the nature of the people ingeneral.
My dear Brothers and sisters, I was just watching the TV news two days ago that electricity has reached three villages of the Elephanta island after 70 years of independence, and this has led to much joy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all know very well, that Elephanta is located 10 kms by the sea from Mumbai.
It is a very important tourist destination.
For 70 years, the lives of the denizens of three villages of the Elephanta Island, Rajbunder, Morbandar and Centabandar, were engulfed by darkness, which has got dispelled now and there is brightness in their lives.
I congratulate the administration and the populace there.
I am glad that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lighted due to electrification.
This is not just electricity, but a new beginning of a period of development.
My dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
But this month is also very special to all of us because of the festival of Holi.
On 2nd March the entire country immersed in joy will celebrate the festival of Holi.
Holi makes us forget our rancours and gives us an opportunity to be a part of each other’s happiness and glad tidings, and it conveys the message of love, unity and brotherhood.

India was the first country to contribute a Female Formed Police Unit to UN Mission in Liberia.
Today’s peacekeepers are called upon not only to maintain peace and security, but also address a range of complex challenges.
Peacekeeping missions should be deployed prudently, with full recognition of their limitations and in support of political solutions.
India’s commitment to UN Peacekeeping remains strong and will grow.
We have announced new intended contributions that to the UN Peacekeeping Operations.
These include additional battalion of up to 850 troops in existing or new operations; additional 03 Police units with higher representation of female peacekeepers; commitment to provide critical enablers; deployment of technical personnel in UN missions; and, additional training for peacekeepers at our facilities in India and in the field.
In conclusion, l wish to emphasise that the success of UN peacekeeping ultimately depends not on the weapons that the soldiers carry, but on the moral force that decisions of the UN Security Council command.
We must complete the long-pending task of reforms within a fixed time frame of the UN Security Council to preserve the relevance and effectiveness of the UN.
I am delighted to welcome you, Excellency, on your first State Visit to India.
So, it is indeed an honour for me to welcome such a great friend and strong supporter of India.
And, Cyprus too has always reciprocated with its warmth and friendship.
India has always stood by Cyprus on all crucial issues.
In 1974, India took a firm stand in support of the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus .
India has contributed personnel to the UN Peace Keeping Force in Cyprus.
Under your leadership, Cyprus has successfully overcome its recent financial and banking challenges.
And, recorded one of the highest growth rates in the Euro zone in 2016.
Excellency, we commend your vision and leadership for taking your country out of this crisis and on to the path of economic prosperity.
Today, the President and I have had detailed discussions.
Our conversation covered the full range of bilateral relationship.
We also exchanged perspectives on important global and regional issues of mutual concern.
Cyprus and India enjoy close economic ties.
Cyprus is the 8th largest investor in India.
Last year, to boost our capital and investment linkages, we have revised the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement.
The President and I agreed that India offers excellent investment opportunities for Cypriot entrepreneurs.
The industry and business in our two economies can shape attractive partnerships through the flagship programmes launched by my Government.
The beautiful landscapes of Cyprus and the wide horizons of ‘Incredible India’ can be a source of tourism promotion in both our countries.
India and Cyprus share the common objective of bringing about an early reform of the United Nations Security Council.
Given its location, Cyprus appreciates the threat that terrorism poses to the global peace and stability.
India itself has been battling cross border terrorism for decades.
We agreed that there is an urgent need for all countries to decisively act against those states who generate, support, shelter and sustain these factories of violence in our regions.
I share with you the strong commitment to take our bilateral engagement to a new level.
I am confident that our discussion and decisions today will give a new direction and depth to our partnership.
Thank you very much.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare and the Ministry of Agriculture in the State of Palestine on agriculture cooperation.

He was intervening during the debate in the Lok Sabha on the GST Bill.
The Prime Minister noted the date – 8th August – and recalled that in 1942, on this very day Mahatma Gandhi had given the call for the Quit India Movement.
He said that today, the country would begin its march towards freedom from tax terrorism.
He described the imminent passage of the Bill as a victory not for any political party, but for Indian democracy.
Recalling the discussions and parleys on the Goods and Services Tax, the Prime Minister said that he had invited both Ms. Sonia Gandhi and former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh to discuss the same.
He noted that one of them was a Lok Sabha MP and the other was a Rajya Sabha MP.
The Prime Minister said that the consensus over GST is proving that Rashtraneeti is above Rajneeti (national issues are above politics) in India.
With GST, we intend to bring uniformity in taxation, said the Prime Minister, adding that the consumer would be supreme in the new dispensation.
The Prime Minister mentioned the judicious use of man, money, machine, material and minutes (time) as an important principle of sound economic policy, and said GST would aid in achieving this.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar!
We recently lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri Sector in Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute these valiant soldiers and pay my tributes to them.
This cowardly act has shocked the entire Nation.
In fact, it is a national loss.
And, therefore, I will just reiterate to you, my countrymen, what I had said that very day, that the guilty will certainly be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our armed forces.
They will foil with their valour every such conspiracy, and they are the ones to reach the pinnacle of bravery so that we, their 1.25 billion fellow countrymen, can live peacefully and be happy.
I also wish today to specially talk to those living in Kashmir.
Kashmiris are now beginning to recognize well the true face of the anti-national forces.
And as they understand the truth better, they are now separating themselves from such elements and have started moving on the path of peace.
Every parent wants the schools and colleges to be functioning properly at the earliest.
And during the last few days there has been a movement towards restoration of trading activities.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the only way to solve our problems and also the way to our progress and development.
We have to scale greater heights of development for the sake of our future generations.
I am very sure that by sitting together we shall definitely find solutions to our problems, find ways to move ahead and also pave a better path for future generations in Kashmir.
Providing security to people in Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration.
The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
At times, people thinking differently from us also provide new ideas.
These days I get to learn quite a lot through social media.
I get an opportunity to know and understand views of different people from all corners of the country and this actually adds to the strength of our democracy.
Recently, Harshvardhan, a young student of Eleventh Class has put before me a different type of thought.
Brother Harshvardhan, I am happy to know that despite this atmosphere charged with anger, you are able to think in a healthy manner at such a young age.
But, dear Harshvardhan, I shall also like to add that the anger in the hearts of our countrymen is of a very high value.
It symbolises our national consciousness.
This anger has the resolve to do something.
Then, Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji had very aptly tried to touch the emotional universe of the country.
He gave the mantra-“Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” which inspired the common people of the country to work for the nation.
Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji showed that even amidst the deafening sounds of gunfire and bombardment, there existed an alternative way for every citizen for expressing patriotism.
During the freedom movement, Mahatma Gandhi also used to mount highly successful experiments to divert the strong energy of that movement towards constructive social work, whenever a lull was needed amidst the extreme intensity in that movement.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.S. Kartik has written on NarendraModiApp that our athletes who participated in the Paralympics have created a new history and their performance is a triumph of the human spirit.
Shri Varun Vishwanathan has also written on NarendraModiApp that our athletes did a commendable job and that I should talk about this in ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
Not only the two of you but each one of our countrymen has felt an emotional attachment with our athletes who participated at the Paralympics.
Perhaps going beyond sporting achievements, these Paralympics and the performance by our athletes have transformed our attitude towards humanity, towards specially-abled, DIVYANG people.
And, I shall never be able to forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik had to say.
When the medal was awarded to her, she said – “Through this medal I have actually defeated the disability itself.”
Mariyappan Thangavelu won a gold medal in High Jump.
He is not from a big city, he does not come from a middle class or rich family.
Yet despite facing all sorts of difficulties and physical challenges, at the age of 21, through his unwavering determination he won the medal for the country.
As far as Athlete Deepa Malik is concerned, she has won laurels many a times by emerging victorious repeatedly.
Varun C. Bhati won a bronze medal in High Jump.
Medals in Paralympics have a significance of their own, but going beyond that these medals have made a very big contribution in transforming the attitude towards our DIVYANG brothers and sisters in our country, our society and our neighborhoods.
These have not only inspired our empathy but also changed the way of looking at the DIVYANG people.
Only very few people might be knowing as to what stupendous feats were performed by these DIVYANG people in the Paralympics this time.
Olympic Games were held at the same venue only a few days ago.
Not only this, what really surprised me was the fact that the athlete, who finished fourth in this event amongst DIVYANG persons and thus missed winning any medal, actually took less time than the gold medalist of general category in completing the race.
My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
Government of India had organized a Mega Camp for DIVYANG persons and a number of world records were established that day.
These were very inspiring incidents.
Government of India created a world record in Navsari which I believe to be very important.
The task of fitting hearing aids to 600 hearing impaired DIVYANG people in just eight hours was completed successfully.
This deed found a mention in Guinness Book of World Records.
Three world records in a single day by DIVYANG people is a matter of great pride for our countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we had launched ‘Swachha Bharat Mission’ two years ago on 2nd October, the birth anniversary of our revered Bapu.
Now it is going to be nearly two years on 2nd October and I can confidently say that one hundred and twenty five crore people of the country have now become more aware about cleanliness.
I had said ‘one step towards cleanliness’ and today we can say that each one of us has definitely tried to take one step further.
This means that the country has taken 125 crore steps in the direction of achieving cleanliness.
This affirms that the direction we have taken is correct and also fruits of the action are very sweet.
It has also been seen as to how much can be achieved through making small efforts.
Everyone, be it a common citizen, an administrator, in Government offices or roads, bus stops or railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, from children to old persons, rural poor, farming women- everyone is contributing something in achieving cleanliness.
Friends in the media have also played a constructive role.
I also know that we still have to go much farther.
This conviction is important.
If we talk of rural India, so far 2 crore 48 lakh or say about two and a half crore toilets have been constructed and we intend to build another one and a half crore toilets in the coming one year.
From the point of view of sanitation and keeping in mind the dignity of our citizens, especially the dignity of our mothers and sisters, it is necessary to put an end to the habit of defecating in the open.
And, with this in view ‘Open Defecation Free’ or ODF Campaign has been launched.
I visited Gujarat recently and the officers there informed me that Porbandar, the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi, will achieve the target of total ODF on 2nd October, 2016.
My congratulations to those who have made it possible, and best wishes to those who are trying to reach the target.
I appeal to all of my countrymen that to maintain the dignity of our mothers and sisters and for the sake of health of our children, our country needs to get rid of this scourge.
Let us forge ahead with a strong resolution.
I specially want to suggest a scheme to my young friends who are currently technology savvy.
By dialing this number 1-9-6-9 you will be able to know the progress of construction of toilets in your city and will also be able to submit an application for construction of a toilet.
You must avail this facility.
Not only this, a cleanliness, that is Swachchhata App has been launched for people to lodge complaints concerning cleanliness and also to know about the progress in resolving these complaints.
They can also be sent to various districts as Swachchha Bharat Fellows.
Waste to wealth should also be one of its components.
It is, therefore, imperative that we need to move towards ‘Waste to Compost’ along with the Cleanliness Mission.
Solid waste should be processed and be converted into Compost and the government has initiated a policy intervention in this regard.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the Compost made out of waste.
They should supply this to the farmers who are willing to adopt organic farming.
This should also be supplied to those farmers who care about the health of their soil and are willing to improve its quality and also to those farmers whose soil quality has deteriorated because of over use of chemical fertilizers.
And for this, Shrimaan Amitabh Bachchan Ji is making a significant contribution as a brand ambassador.
And I see clearly that the news about cleanliness keeps pouring in.
Each department is to focus exclusively on cleanliness for a period of 15 days.
In the coming October month, from 1st October to 15th October, Drinking Water and Sanitation Department, Panchayati Raj Department and Rural Development Department – these three are going to work under a designated roadmap in their respective areas.
Then during last two weeks of October from 16th October to 31st October, three more departments, namely – Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs are going to take up cleanliness campaigns in the concerned areas.
I request the citizens also to get involved, wherever they feel that they too can pitch in these programmes.
You might have seen that a cleanliness survey campaign is also carried out these days.
Earlier, the cleanliness status was presented before the countrymen after conducting a survey of 73 cities.
Now, this survey will be conducted in about 500 cities with a population of more than 1 lakh.
Each city will imbibe a sense of confidence that, well, we have lagged behind but we will surely perform better next time.
In this manner an atmosphere of competition for cleanliness has been created.
I expect that all of us citizens should contribute as much as we can in the cleanliness mission.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
Swachchh Bharat Mission is completing two years on this day.
I keep on urging everyone to buy some khadi items between Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This year also I request that each family should buy one or the other khadi item so that the poor may also be able to light an earthen lamp and celebrate Diwali.
If it is a video, then share the video.
You will see that with our joint efforts, this movement will get a fresh boost, a new dynamism.
Let us all remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and take a pledge to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, one gets a special pleasure in giving, one may not realize it, but the pleasure of giving is divine.
Under this campaign, food items and clothes will be collected and supplied to the needy persons.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to walk the streets seeking donations of old toys from families and then presented these toys to Anganwadis in poor neighbourhoods.
These toys provided great pleasure to the poor children, which was a great sight to behold.
I feel that we should encourage and help these young people who are organising ‘Joy of Giving Week’ in many cities.
I convey my best wishes to all those young persons who are undertaking this mission.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Ji and his birth centenary year commences from today.
‘Sarvajan Hitay – Sarvajan Sukhay’, the principle of ANTYODAY – these are his gifts to us.
Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the last man standing in the queue.
How can the poorest of the poor avail of benefits of development?
‘Work for every hand, water to every field’ – through only these two words he presented his entire economic agenda.
The country should celebrate his centenary year as GARIB KALYAN VARSH, ‘Year for Welfare of the Poor’.
We can alleviate poverty when everyone including society and governments focuses attention on measures to provide benefits of development to the poor.
The place where I live was known as Race Course Road since British rule but now in the centenary year of Pandit Deen Dayal Updhyay this has been named ‘Lok Kalyan Marg’.
My dear countrymen, I had started ‘Mann Ki Baat’ on Vijayadashmi two years ago.
My sincere effort was that ‘Mann Ki Baat’ should not become a programme of praising and highlighting only government’s achievements; Mann Ki Baat should not become a programme of political oneupmanship, allegations and counter allegations. and sometimes passionate advocacy.
Despite numerous pressures during these past two years – sometimes being tempted due the surrounding atmosphere, at times with provocations to say something with indignation – overcoming all such impulses over these two years with your blessings, I have moved through these obstacles and earnestly tried to connect with the common man through Mann Ki Baat.
How the common man of this country keeps on inspring me all the time?
Be it Navratri or Durga Puja – how can this SHAKTI-UPASANA become the festival of celebrating social unity?
How to make it a festival of social bonding?
And that would be the true prayer to Shakti, only then can we celebrate together the festival of victory.
Thank you very much.
Dear friends!
I welcome you at the launch of the Russian-Indian enterprise for production of Kalashnikov assault rifles.
Military and technical cooperation has traditionally been one of the key areas of special and privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India.
For more than seven decades, we have been supplying reliable and high-quality armaments and equipment to Indian friends.
Around 170 military and industrial facilities have been set up in India with assistance from our country.
Let me remind you that it was during my official visit to India last October that my counterpart and friend Mr Modi and I reached the agreement on setting up Kalashnikov production in this country.
The respective intergovernmental agreement was prepared and signed in the shortest possible time.
I am convinced that commissioning of the new enterprise will contribute to stronger defence potential of India, to further advance of the scientific and industrial basis of the national economy, will be instrumental in terms of creating new jobs for qualified work force, and will provide an impetus to professional education and personnel training.
The plant itself will become another symbol of friendship and constructive cooperation between our two countries.
I wish you every success and all the best.
The MoU was signed on 1st November 2018.
The collaboration between India and the USA will enable sharing of the expertise available with organizations in both countries, and adoption of the latest state-of-the-art technology in the field of Earth Science.
Specific areas of cooperation include ecosystems, climate variability and land-use changes, energy, minerals, environmental health, natural hazards, risk and resilience of assessments, water resources, and informatics and data integration.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Rasmussen held bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in Gandhinagar on 18 January 2019.
The two Prime Ministers had earlier met during the first India- Nordic summit in Stockholm in April 2018.
In the meeting, the two leaders deliberated upon various areas of bilateral cooperation and also exchanged views on multilateral issues of mutual interest.
They underscored the huge potential for expanding bilateral trade and investments between the two countries.
Denmark is a global leader in several niche technologies which are of relevance to India.
Mentioning that Denmark has skills, India has scale and world has the need for new technologies, PM Modi encouraged India and Denmark to establish a research platform where solutions could be found to global issues of concern such as food security, water management, climate change and sustainable development.
During the meeting, two MOUs were exchanged- MoU on Maritime Issues between the Ministry of Shipping of India and the Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs of Denmark and MoU between Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Limited and the Danish Embassy in New Delhi to establish an Urban Living Lab in Panaji, Goa.
Around 130 Danish companies have invested in India in areas such as shipping, renewable energy, environment, agriculture and food processing and are keen to expand their engagements in other sectors like smart urban development and waste-to-energy.
Several major Danish companies are also present in Gujarat in shipping and renewable energy sectors.
During the visit, Prime Minister Rasmussen will inaugurate the Danish Cultural Institute and the new building of Danish Embassy in New Delhi on 19 January 2019.
He will also visit Agra.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval for the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) among Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China, South Africa, regarding Cooperation in the Social and Labour Sphere.
The member countries may utilize the BRICS Network of Labour Research Institutes and BRICS Social Security Cooperation Framework for cooperation on Social Security and other labour issues.
This would facilitate member countries to share knowledge and also implement joint programmes on .matter of Labour and Employment, Social Security and Social dialogue.
Nation is celebrating the Independence Day with the festival of Janamashtmi today .
I can see a number of Bal Kanahiyas here.
We are fortunate to have in our cultural and historical heritage from a Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan to Charkhadhari Mohan.
Our 125 crore countrymen stand shoulder to shoulder with them in this hour of crisis and grief.
I assure the countrymen that in this hour of crisis we shall leave no stone unturned to ensure the wellbeing of all.
My dear countrymen, this year is a special year for independent India.
We are aware of the power of the collective resolve, hard work, sacrifice and devotion of our 125 crore citizens.
Lord Krishna was immensely powerful, but it is only when the milkmen came out with sticks in his support that they could lift the Govardhan parvat.
The collective resolve and strength of the people got freedom for our country.
No one is small or big.
Our freedom movement is linked to our sentiments.
We know it well that at the time of the freedom movement, the teacher who was engaged in teaching, the farmer who was tilling his land, the laborer who was working – all of them knew in their hearts that whatever they were doing, was contributing towards the independence of the country.
This idea is a great source of strength.
In the family, food is prepared everyday but it becomes ‘prasad’ only when it is offered to the deity.
Our country, our military, our brave-hearts, our uniformed forces, be it any force, not just the army, air force or navy, all the uniformed forces, whenever they were called upon to do so, they showed their valour, their strength; our brave-hearts never turned their back in making the supreme sacrifice.
Be it Left-Wing-Extremism, be it terrorism, be it infiltrators, be it the elements fomenting trouble inside our country- the uniformed forces of our country have made extreme sacrifices.
And when the surgical strike was carried out, then the world had to acknowledge India’s capability and strength.
My beloved countrymen,
Those who have looted the nation and looted the poor are not able to sleep peacefully today.
Due to this, the confidence of the hardworking and honest person is increasing.
An honest man now feels that his honesty matters.
This gives us new hope.
The law against Benami property was lying in limbo for years.
Now, we have come up with a law against Benami Property.
In such a short time, the government has confiscated Benami properties worth over Rs.800 crores.
When these things happen, the common man develops faith that the country is for the honest persons.
The ‘One Rank – One Pension’ policy for our defence forces was stuck up for 30-40 years.
Our government implemented it.
When we fulfill the aspirations of our soldiers, then their morale goes high and their resolve to protect the nation grows manifold.
The country has many states and a Central Government.
GST has shown the spirit of cooperative federalism and has given competitive cooperative federalism a new strength.
The success of GST can be attributed to the hard work that has been put in to make it a success.
Technology has made it look like a miracle.
The global community is surprised how we were able to roll out GST in such a short time.
It is a reflection of our capability and helps in building the confidence and faith of the future generations.
New systems are emerging.
More than 14 thousand villages that were hitherto shrouded in darkness even after Independence, have been provided with electricity.
The person at the last mile of development now joins the mainstream and the nation is marching ahead.
If a person belonging to the middle-class wants to build his house, then he gets a loan at a lower rate of interest.
In this way, the country is moving forward and people are joining the movement.
The times have changed.
By reiterating this we have enforced faster decision making.
And that is why 125 crore countrymen have been able to repose faith in our governance.
You will be happy to know that we are not alone in our fight against terrorism.
Many nations are proactively supporting us.
Be it Hawala, or any inputs related to terrorism, the global community is supporting us with critical information.
We have joined hands with other nations in the combined fight against terrorism.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to all those countries who are standing in solidarity with us and acknowledge our prowess.
We are committed to restore the state to its former glory so as to experience the paradise that it was, once again.
On Kashmir there is rhetoric and politics.
But I am clear in my belief on how to win the war against separatism, which is spread by a handful of people.
The process of engagement can take place only by their joining the mainstream.
I deeply appreciate the efforts of security forces in curbing the Left Wing extremism which mobilized a lot of youth from these regions to surrender and joined the mainstream.
Security forces are keeping a tight vigil on our borders.
I am delighted to announce that today the Indian Government is launching a website which will give an account of the valour of the Gallantry Award winners.
People from around the world have appreciated this model and have been studying it.
A common man living thousands of kilometres away can now supply his products to the Government.
When a work is stalled, the poor families are the ones who suffer the most.
It sets in doubts in the minds of the poor.
It is a concrete example of federalism in its real sense.
But we have reduced our democracy to mere ballot boxes.
However, democracy cannot be confined only to ballot boxes.
Lokmanya Tilak Ji had said “Swaraj is my birthright”.
When we move from “Swaraj” to “Suraja”, the citizens do not lag behind.
For example, when I called upon the countrymen to give up gas subsidy, the nation responded as a whole.
When demonetization was announced, the world was surprised.
With this new practice of people’s participation, our effort to take the country forward with people’s involvement will help us to reach our goal.
Our farmers have not looked back since then.
They are now producing record harvests and scaling new heights despite facing natural adversities.
There has been a record production of pulses this year.
The number is soon going to touch the 5.75 crore mark.
That is why I had made some announcements from the ramparts of Red Fort on the last Independence Day.
Out of those, we have completed 21 projects and remaining 50 would be completed soon.
I have resolved to complete 99 big projects.
By completing those 99 big projects before 2019, we shall fulfill our commitment.
We cannot change the lot of our farmers until we hand hold him from procuring seeds to ensure that his produce reaches the market.
For this we need infrastructure and supply chain.
Every year vegetables, fruits and grains worth lakhs of crores of rupees are wasted.
In order to change the situation, the government has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment in food processing sector.
Government of India has launched ‘Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojna’ to encourage infrastructure building.
With the changes in demand and technology, the nature of jobs in our country has been changing.
The Government has launched several new initiatives in the employment related schemes and also in the manner in which the training is imparted for the development of human resource according to the needs of the 21st century.
We have launched a massive program to provide collateral free loans to the youth.
Our youth should become independent, he should get the employment, he should become the provider of employment.
In the education sector, we have taken an important step to grant the universities freedom from restrictions to make them the world class universities.
We have asked 20 universities to decide their own destiny.
The government will not interfere in their functioning.
We have appealed to them and I am confident that the education institutions of our country will certainly come forward and make it a success.
My mothers and sisters, the women in the families seek employment in large numbers.
And therefore we have taken a very important step to reform the labour laws to provide them the employment opportunities in the night also.
And that is why we have decided to increase the paid maternity leave to 26 weeks from the earlier 12 weeks.
In the context of women empowerment, I’d like to honour those sisters who have been forced to lead a very difficult life due to ‘Triple Talaq’.
There is no recourse for them, and such victims of ‘Triple Talaq’ have launched a massive movement in the country.
I heartily commend those sisters who have launched this movement, who have been fighting against the ‘Triple Talaq’ and I’m confident that the country will help them in this struggle.
The country will help these mothers and sisters in securing this right.
India will fully support them and they will ultimately achieve success in this very important step in the direction of women empowerment; I am fully confident about this.
The country is governed by peace, harmony and unity.
The poison of casteism and communalism can never benefit the country.
The country will never accept this.
And that is why I’d like to appeal to all the countrymen that at that time our motto was ‘Bharat Chodo’ and today’s slogan is ‘Bharat Jodo’.
We have to take everyone and every section of the society along to take the country forward.
We may have brought a number of new laws and systems such as the GST, but we have successfully accomplished the task and the work goes on.
We have laid emphasis on infrastructure.
It has tremendous potential, rich human resources, immense natural wealth, work force and it has the power to change lives.
You must have seen that we used to extend the days from 7 days to 10 days to 15 days; sometimes we allowed the old notes at the petrol pump, at the chemist shops, and sometimes at the railway stations, because our intention was to bring all money into the formal banking system and we achieved success in completing the task.
According to the research conducted by outside experts, about Rs.3 lakh crores that had never come into the banking system before, has been brought into the system after the demonetization.
More than Rs. 1.75 lakh crores deposited in the banks is under the scanner.
Black money worth Rs. 2 lakh crore had to be deposited in the banks and this system has forced them to be accountable.
It has also stopped the flow of black money.
In a way it has more than doubled.
This is the result of our fight against black money.
There was no one to question them.
Such moves are giving a fillip to the economic growth of the country.
India is known in the world for its prowess in IT and Digital World.
Should we still remain in the old mind-set?
There was a time when leather coins were in vogue, but gradually they ceased to exist.
We should also work through prepaid systems.
I am happy that there has been an increase in Digital transactions.
We should move towards a less-cash economy.
My Dear Countrymen, some schemes of the Government are meant for ensuring savings for the common man.
If you use LED bulbs, you can save Rs.2000 to Rs. 5000 per year.
If we succeed in Swachh Bharat, poor will be able to save Rs. 7000 on medicines that they would otherwise have spent.
Curbing inflation has helped people in saving money in a way.
Cheap medicines through Jan Aushadhi Kendras are a boon to the poor.
There used to be a lot of expenditure on operations and stents.
We are striving to make it possible for knee operations as well.
We are striving to minimize this expenditure for the poor and the middle class.
Earlier there used to be Dialysis only at the State capitals.
Now we have decided to open Dialysis Centres at district level.
We have already opened this facility in 350 to 400 districts where free Dialysis services are available for the poor.
We can take pride in the fact that we have developed various systems to showcase to the world.
We have been able to develop the ‘NAVIC Navigation System’ through GPS.
We have helped the neighbouring countries by successfully launching SAARC Satellite.
We asserted our supremacy in the world by introducing Tejas aircraft.
BHIM Aadhaar App for digital transaction has come as a surprise to the world.
So we will together build such an India where the poor will have Pucca House with electricity and water.
Together we will build such an India where the farmers can sleep without worry.
They will earn double by 2022 of what they are earning today.
Together we will build such an India where the youth, the women will have enough opportunities to fulfil their dreams.
Together we will build such an India which will be free from terrorism, communalism and casteism.
Together we will build such an India where nobody will compromise with corruption and nepotism.
Together we will build such an India which will be clean and healthy, and where the dream of Su-Raj will be fulfilled.
And that is why my dear fellow countrymen, we will together strive to move ahead in this march towards development.
I bow my head before the new confidence and passion of my 125 crore countrymen and I call upon Team India to march on with this new pledge.
With this thought I convey my hearty congratulations to all of you.
Thanking you all.

He is expected to touch upon several matters of vital interest to the MSME sector.
The Union Government has accorded high priority to the MSME sector in recent years.
The progress of this programme, to be implemented in mission mode, will be monitored on a continuous basis by senior officials of Union and State Governments.
Prime Minister also spoke to many Heads of State and Government and greeted them on this auspicious occasion.

As I have said earlier, both our countries reflect, in many ways, similar aspirations, challenges and opportunities, and can be inspired by each other’s successes.
At a time when the world looks towards Asia, the progress and prosperity of China and India, and our close cooperation, have the potential to shape a peaceful and stable future for Asia.
This is a vision I share with President Xi and Premier Li.
In recent times, we have deepened our engagement across the full spectrum of our ties, and laid emphasis on deepening mutual trust and confidence, and expansion of people-to-people ties.

The 9/11 of 1893 was about love, harmony and brotherhood, he added.
He recalled that Swami Vivekananda said that only rituals will not connect an individual to divinity; he said that ‘Jan Seva’ is ‘Prabhu Seva.’
Swami Vivekananda did not believe in sermonising, the Prime Minister said.
His ideas and idealism paved way for an institutional framework through the Ramakrishna Mission, he added.
Student organisations, while campaigning for university elections should give more importance to cleanliness, the Prime Minister said.
He said that only those who respect women, can take legitimate pride in the opening words of Swami Vivekananda’s address – “Brothers and sisters of America.”
The correspondence between Swami Vivekananda and Jamsetji Tata will show the concern Swami ji had towards India’s self-reliance, the Prime Minister said.
Both knowledge and skills are equally important, the Prime Minister added.
This summit is a re-inforcement of India’s commitment to a sustainable planet, for ourselves and for future generations.
As a nation, we are proud of our long history and tradition of harmonious co-existence between man and nature.
Respect for nature is an integral part of our value system.
Our traditional practices contribute to a sustainable lifestyle.
This is the ideal we seek to live through our actions.
We believe that all resources and all wealth belongs to Nature and the Almighty.
We are just the trustees or managers of this wealth.
Mahatma Gandhi too, advocated this trusteeship philosophy.
As the world committed to bring about change, so did we.
While the world was discussing ‘Inconvenient Truth’, we translated it into ‘Convenient Action’.
India believes in growth but is also committed to protecting the environment.
Friends, it was with this thought that India, along with France, initiated the International Solar Alliance.
It already has one hundred and twenty one members.
It is perhaps, the single most important global achievement after Paris.
Our goal of creating a carbon sink of two point five to three billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030had once seemed difficult to many.
Yet we continue our steady progress on that path.
According to the UNEP Gap Report, India is on track to meet its Copenhagen Pledge of reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by twenty to twenty-five percent over 2005 levels by 2020.
We are also on track to meet the 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution.
The UN Sustainable Development Goals put us on the path of equality, equity and climate justice.
While we are doing everything that is required of us, we expect that others also join in to fulfil their commitments based on Common but Differentiated Responsibility and equity.
We must also stress on climate justice for all vulnerable populations.
We in India are focused on Ease of living –through Good Governance, Sustainable Livelihood and through Cleaner Environment.
We have also launched a massive campaign to ensure that our farmers convert agricultural waste to valuable nutrients, instead of burning them.
That is why we have introduced the massive Namami Gange initiative.
This programme, which has already started giving results, will soon revive the Ganga, our most precious river.
Our country is primarily agrarian.
Continued availability of water for agriculture is of importance.
The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojanahas been launched to ensure that no farm goes without water.
Our motto is ‘More crop, per drop.’
India has a fairly decent report card on bio-diversity conservation.
India has gained international recognition for ten out of its eighteen Biosphere reserves under UNESCO’s Man and Biosphere programme.
This is a testimony that our development is green and our wildlife is robust.
India has always believed in making the benefits of good governance reach everyone.
Our mission of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas is an extension of this philosophy.
Through this philosophy, we are ensuring that some of our most deprived areas experience social and economic progress on par with others.
In this day and age, access to electricity and clean cooking solutions are basics that every person must be provided with.
These form the core of any country’s economic development.
Yet, there are many in India and outside who are struggling in the absence of these solutions.
From the time that they were launched, these schemes have already impacted the lives of millions.
With these twin programs, the time when mothers would fetch dry wood from forests or prepare cow dung cakes, to feed their families will be gone soon.
Soon too, the images of traditional firewood stoves will only remain a picture in our social history texts.
We recognize that only a healthy nation can lead the process of development.
Keeping this in mind, we have launched the world’s largest government funded health scheme.
The programme will support hundred million poor families.
Our ‘Housing for All’ and ‘Power for All ’initiatives also stem from this same agenda of providing the basic amenities of life to those who cannot afford them.
You know that India is one sixth of the global community.
Our development needs are enormous.
Our poverty or prosperity will have direct impact on the global poverty or prosperity.
People in India have waited too long for access to modern amenities and means of development.
We have committed to complete this task sooner than anticipated.
However, we have also said that we will do all this in a cleaner and greener way.
To give you just a few examples.
We are a young Nation.
To give employment to our youth, we have decided to make India a global manufacturing hub.
We have launched the Make in India campaign for this.
However, at the same time, we are insisting on Zero defect and zero effect manufacturing.
As the world’s fastest growing major economy, our energy needs are immense.
With this, we are already the fifth largest producer of solar energy in the world.
Not only this, we are also the sixth largest producer of renewable energy.
With growing urbanization our transportation needs are growing too.
But we are focusing on mass transportation systems especially metro rail systems.
Even for cargo movement to long distances, we have started working on national water-way systems.
Each of our states is preparing an action plan against climate change.
This will ensure that while we are working towards conserving our environment, we also safe-guard our most vulnerable areas.
One of our largest states, Maharashtra, has already adopted a plan of its own in this direction.
We intend to achieve each of our sustainable development objectives on our own, but collaboration remains the key.
Collaboration between governments, between industries, and between people.
The developed world can help us achieve them faster.
Successful climate action needs access to financial resources and technology.
We are here today to act upon the belief that we as humans can make a difference to this planet.
We need to understand that this planet, our Mother Earth, is one.
And so, we should rise above our trivial differences of race, religion, and power, and act as one to save her.
Bilateral cooperation in the field of food processing between India and Japan will be mutually beneficial to the food processing sector in both countries.
It will promote understanding of best practices in food processing in the two countries and will help in improving the food processing sector as well as improved market access, leading to equity and inclusiveness.
The MoC will lead to betterment of the food processing sector in the country by introducing innovative techniques and processes.
Before arriving on the stage here, I visited an exhibition of stalls set up by Self-Help Groups comprising women from all eight North Eastern States.
The artefacts and products displayed in this exhibition are indeed impressive.
Let me begin by congratulating the ladies from these Self-Help Groups, who are present here today and have just given me a glimpse of their immense talent.
The promotion of Self Help Groups has got a boost from the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana.
The Government is committed to the development of Self Help Groups, particularly Women Self Help Groups.
Keeping this in mind, in December 2015, the Union Cabinet approved a Special Package Fund for the North Eastern States.
The objective is to accelerate the implementation of the National Rural Livelihood Mission, so as to cover two-thirds of all rural households in North Eastern States by 2023-24.
Today, I unveiled a plaque for the foundation stone of a football stadium.
We are all aware of the love that the people of the North-East, and especially Meghalaya, have for Football.
Football is a passion here and is played in every nook and corner.
We are all familiar with famous football players such as Eugeneson Lyngdoh, Aibor Khongjee, and Marlangki Suting.
They have done both the country and the State proud, by representing India in International Tournaments, and their clubs in the Indian Super League.
I am sure that the football stadium being constructed at a cost of 38 crore rupees with the support of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region, will go a long way towards fulfilling this objective.
Next year, that is in 2017, India is hosting the Under-17 FIFA World Cup.
We need to take advantage of this event being held in India; and ensure the spread and development of this sport not only in the North Eastern Region, but also in other parts of the country.
Meghalaya has a large number of football clubs and associations.
Perhaps, you can organize competitive local tournaments and lead the way for other parts of the country, to build a series of major events leading to the Under-17 World Cup.
We all know Cherrapunji, for being the place that receives the highest rainfall in the World.
Today, another feather has been added to its cap.
The Doppler Weather Radar at Cherrapunji has been dedicated to the Nation.
I congratulate the Indian Space Research Organization; Bharat Electronics Ltd.; and the Indian Meteorological Department for setting up this Radar in Cherrapunji.
Earlier today, I had an opportunity to participate in the North Eastern Council Meeting and interact with the Governors and Chief Ministers of this region.
My Government has been proactively following the ‘Act East Policy’.
I consider the North Eastern Region as the Gateway to South-East Asia.
As part of this policy, it is our mission to upgrade the infrastructure in Road, Rail, Telecom, Power and Waterways in the region.
And today, as part of that mission, I have flagged off three new trains.
We are committed to connect all North Eastern States with the country’s railway network.
Since the formation of the NDA Government at the Centre, we have spent more than Ten Thousand Crore Rupees for development of the railway network in the North East.
The Railway Ministry plans to spend more than Five Thousand Crore Rupees during the current year for the same.
In November, 2014, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh were brought on the rail map of India.
Recently, Agartala in Tripura has been connected with a broad gauge railway line.
Today is indeed a red letter day in the history of the North-East.
Broad Gauge Passenger Trains will now connect the States of Manipur and Mizoram.
Today, Kamakhya in Guwahati has been directly connected with Vaishno Devi in Katra, near Jammu.
We are opening up both Road and Rail routes to our neighbouring countries.
This will give a boost to the economic development of the region.
The Union Government has incorporated a special Corporation named ‘National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation’ in July 2014, for the development of Highways in the North Eastern region.
This Corporation is constructing three new bridges on Brahmaputra River.
It is implementing 34 road projects in the North Eastern Region to construct around 1,000 kilometers of roads at a total cost of over Ten Thousand Crore Rupees.
The North East Road Sector Development Scheme has been started, with an aim to connect every district in the region with a National Highway.
We are committed to provide 24 by 7 electricity to all the people.
Keeping this in mind, the Union Government is making heavy investment in the power sector.
Two projects covering all the eight North Eastern States are being implemented at a cost of around Ten Thousand Crore Rupees for improving power transmission.
The commissioning of the Bishwanath-Chariyali to Agra transmission network has made available 500 Megawatts of power in the region from outside.
Out of the 18,000 unelectrified villages in the country, we have already connected more than 7000 villages with electricity.
I expect that no village in the country, including the North Eastern States, will be left without electricity by 2018.
The Government is implementing a comprehensive Telecom Plan for the North Eastern Region at a cost of over 5,300 crore rupees.
Agartala has become the third city in India to be connected with an International Gateway through Cox Bazar of Bangladesh.
This has improved telecom connectivity and will give a boost to the economic development of the region.
During my last visit to Gangtok a few months ago, Sikkim was declared as the First Organic State in the country.
Other North Eastern States can take a lead from Sikkim to become Organic States.
In fact, the North Eastern Region has the potential to become Organic Food Basket of India.
This will increase the income of the farmers.
Today one need not go through the tedious scrutiny of a banker to get small loans.
During 2015-16, more than three crore forty eight lakh entrepreneurs have been sanctioned loans worth more than one lakh thirty seven thousand crore rupees.
Of these, six lakh loans have been sanctioned in the North Eastern States for a value of around 2800 Crore Rupees.
Similarly, 93 Lakh bank accounts have been opened in the region under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
Around 21 Lakh people have been enrolled under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana.
Around 19 Lakh people have been enrolled under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana.
The Textile Sector provides employment to most people after agriculture.
Within the sector, it is the apparel segment that provides maximum employment.
A large number of women are employed in the segment.
In order to boost industrial activity and employment under the North East Region Textile Promotion scheme, one apparel and garment making centre is being set up in each of the eight states at a cost of Rupees One Hundred and Forty Five Crores.
Meghalaya has a distinct historical, cultural and ethnic heritage.
It is blessed with natural beauty and wildlife.
There is no reason for a tourist to not want to visit Meghalaya.
There is a tremendous opportunity for tourism, as well as adventure tourism, in the North Eastern Region, particularly, Meghalaya.
One such circuit is proposed for the North East.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is a public movement for cleanliness.
The biggest beneficiaries of this movement are the poorest of the poor.
I request all of you to actively participate in the movement and ensure an open defecation free society and clean environment.
I am happy to note that the traditions of hygiene and cleanliness in the region got a boost with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Mawlyynong village in Meghalaya, the cleanest village, and the entire state of Sikkim, including Gangtok, have become major tourist attractions.
I would like to congratulate all the winners of the run with the theme ‘North East leads the way – Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’.
I congratulate the North Eastern Council for organizing the run.
Gangtok deserves applause for being ranked the cleanest city of the North East.
Congratulations to the people of Meghalaya for hosting the North Eastern Council Plenary Meeting in Shillong.
I also express my gratitude to all of you for giving me the opportunity for a wonderful interaction.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will visit Arunachal Pradesh tomorrow.
At a function in Itanagar, he will inaugurate the Dorjee Khandu State Convention Centre.
This Convention Centre has an auditorium, conference halls and an exhibition hall.
It is expected to become a significant landmark of Itanagar.
The Prime Minister will also dedicate the State Civil Secretariat Building to the nation, and lay the Foundation Stone of the Academic Block of the Tomo Riba Institute of Health and Medical Science.

Congrats to all sports lovers on the inauguration of the synthetic track in ”Usha School of Athletics”.
I take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of our own Payyoli Express, ‘Udan Pari’ and ‘Golden Girl’ of India P.T. Usha ji for the development of this school.
P.T.Usha has been a shining light of sports in India.
In the history of Indian athletics very few have achieved a track record like hers.
What is even better is that Usha ji has continued her association with sports.
Like Usha ji, ”USHA School” is making the best use of every opportunity by utilizing simple and limited resources.
But then, Better late than Never.
One of the top-most priorities of our Government is speedy implementation and completion of projects in the designated time period.
I have been informed that this track is full PUR track.
Sports is closely linked with the human resource development of a society.
“Greetings to all soldiers, veterans & their families on Army Day.
We salute the courage & invaluable service of the Indian Army.
Indian Army always leads from the front, be it in protecting the sovereignty of our nation or helping citizens during natural disasters.
We remember with great pride all the sacrifices made by our Army.
Chief Justice of India, Justice T. S. Thakur,
Hon’ble Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts,
Distinguished Guests and Friends,
Let me begin by congratulating NITI Aayog for organizing this global conference.
“I had learnt the true practice of law.
I had learnt to find out the better side of human nature and to enter men’s heart.
I realized that the true function of a lawyer is to unite the parties involved in a dispute.
India is today the fastest growing major economy, and one of the most attractive destinations for FDI.
Indeed, we stand out as a bright spot in the global economy.
This is the result of India’s fundamental strengths: democracy, demographic dividend and demand.
We need to fully harness these strengths.
This can happen only if businesses make long-term investments that create jobs and sustain economic growth.
Our domestic market has been fragmented.
Different taxes across different states have made goods and services more expensive.
This has hampered growth in inter-state commerce.
We are enacting a Goods and Services Tax law, to create an integrated national market.
This will further boost domestic demand, create more opportunities for Indian business and drive job creation.
India is experiencing a digital revolution.
This is bridging the digital and economic divide in Indian society in general; and rural society in particular.
A boost to the rural economy through this revolution will make the Indian economy even more robust.
Innovative business models and app-based start-ups have instilled a spirit of enterprise among Indians.
From cause-lists to case-laws, the lawyer’s library is now just a click away on your mobile phone.
Businesses seek assurance of the prevalence of rule of law in the Indian market.
They need to be assured that the rules of the game will not change overnight, in an arbitrary fashion.
Towards this end, we have initiated far-reaching legal reforms.
Over a thousand archaic laws have been scrapped.
Further, in harmony with the Bankruptcy Code, we have amended the SARFAESI and DRT Acts this year to suit the changing credit landscape and augment ease of doing business.
However, legal reforms can deliver desired results only when there is an effective and efficient dispute resolution mechanism.
The independence of the judiciary is a basic feature of the Indian Constitution.
Common citizens as well as businesses repose immense faith in the integrity of the judicial process.
Our Government has taken various initiatives to improve the judicial infrastructure and administration.
We have enacted the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015, for speedy resolution of commercial disputes.
A National Judicial Data Grid has been set up to provide data on cases pending in district courts across the country.
Steps are being taken under the e-Court Mission to computerize the entire court systems.
Our Government has been working on a strategy for convergence of existing tribunals.
This will help transform the existing complicated tribunal system into a simpler structure.
We need to simultaneously facilitate a vibrant ecosystem for alternate dispute resolution, including arbitration, mediation and conciliation.
This will provide additional comfort to investors and businesses.
More importantly, it will also ease the case-load on Indian courts.
Resolution of disputes through arbitration is not new to us.
In ancient India, there were several mechanisms for settlement of disputes between the parties.
For this, they require specialized arbitration lawyers.
Recent trends indicate that Asian centres like Hong Kong and Singapore have emerged as preferred arbitration destinations.
As popular business hubs, they also rank high in the levels of Ease of Doing Business.
Creation of a vibrant ecosystem for institutional arbitration, is one of the foremost priorities of our Government.
Recently, major amendments have been made to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.
This has made the arbitration process easy, timely and hassle-free.
Our law is based on the UNCITRAL model law.
The objective is to ensure that in normal circumstances, arbitral tribunal makes its award within 12 months.
In case of a fast track procedure, such award can be given in 6 months.
Even the appointment of the arbitrator has to be decided by the Court within a period of 60 days.
The impediments encountered earlier in the grant and process of award, have been removed.
Further, as per the new law, any application challenging the award is to be disposed off by the Court within one year.
The enforcement of award can be refused by the Courts only as per international practices.
These amendments have brought our arbitration process in tune with global best practices.
This has given us an opportunity to emerge as a leading arbitration jurisdiction.
India has no dearth of brilliant lawyers and judges.
India also has a large number of retired judges, engineers, and scientists who can function as competent arbitrators in various fields.
India’s economic interests shall be better served by a higher number of arbitration experts and lawyers.
This in turn requires widening the ambit of legal education in India.
There is need to develop specialized arbitration bar associations.
Mediation is one such mechanism, the potential of which has not been utilized much in the country.
An enabling alternate dispute resolution ecosystem is a national priority for India.
We need to promote India globally as an arbitration hub.
As Roscoe Pound famously remarked, “The law must be stable but it must not stand still.”
We need to take inspiration from beyond our shores.
This conference has provided the ideal platform to deliberate upon the crucial regulatory, policy and mindset reforms on this.
I am sure, the deliberations here shall help in further strengthening Arbitration in India and set a milestone in positioning India as a global hub for arbitration amongst international practitioners, corporate houses and the legal fraternity.
Dr. Fayez Tarawneh, Chief of The Royal Hashemite Court of Jordan called on Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a telephone call today to H. E. Mr. Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China, to congratulate him on his re-election as the President of the People’s Republic of China.
The two leaders agreed that as two major powers growing rapidly, bilateral relations between India and China are vital for the realization of 21st Century as ‘Asian Century’.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the demise of Lok Sabha MP Mahant Chand Nath.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,
Thank you for your friendship, your leadership of India-Singapore partnership and a better future for the region.
Namaskar and a very good evening to all of you!
I am pleased to return to a region, known to India since ancient times as Swarnabhoomi, (the land of gold).
In January, we had the unique honour of hosting ten ASEAN leaders on our Republic Day.
The ASEAN-India Summit was a testimony of our commitment to ASEAN, and to our Act East policy.
For thousands of years, Indians have turned to the East.
Not just to see the Sun rise, but also to pray for its light to spread over the entire world.
The human-kind now looks to the Rising East, with the hope to see the promise that this 21st century beholds for the whole world, because the destiny of the world will be deeply influenced by the course of developments in the Indo-Pacific region.
Because, this new age of promise is also caught in shifting plates of global politics and the fault lines of history.
Free and fearless in their choices.
Singapore also shows that when nations stand on the side of principles, not behind one power or the other, they earn the respect of the world and a voice in international affairs.
And, when they embrace diversity at home, they seek an inclusive world outside.
For India, though, Singapore means more.
Over the past three decades, we have re-claimed that heritage to restore our role and relationships in the region.
For India, no region now receives as much attention as this.
Thousands of years ago, the Indus Valley Civilisation as well as Indian peninsula had maritime trade.
Oceans and Varuna – the Lord of all Waters – find a prominent place in the world’s oldest books- the Vedas.
In ancient Puranas, written thousands of years ago, the geographical definition of India is with reference to the seas: Uttaron Yat Samudrasya meaning, the land which lies to the north of the seas.
Our trade in the region is growing rapidly.
And, a significant part of our overseas investments flow in this direction.
ASEAN alone accounts for over 20%.
Our interests in the region are vast, and our engagement is deep.
In the Indian Ocean region, our relationships are becoming stronger.
We are also helping build economic capabilities and improve maritime security for our friends and partners.
We promote collective security through forums like Indian Ocean Naval Symposium.
We are advancing a comprehensive agenda of regional co-operation through Indian Ocean Rim Association.
And, we also work with partners beyond the Indian Ocean Region to ensure that the global transit routes remain peaceful and free for all.
Three years ago, in Mauritius, I described our vision in one word – Sagar, which means ocean in Hindi.
South-east Asia is our neighbour by land and sea.
With each Southeast Asian country, we have growing political, economic and defence ties.
With ASEAN, from dialogue partners, we have become strategic partners over the course of 25 years.
We pursue our relations through annual summits and 30 dialogue mechanisms.
But even more through a shared vision for the region, and the comfort and familiarity of our old links.
We are active participants in ASEAN-led institutions like East Asia Summit, A.D.M.M. Plus and A.R.F. We are part of BIMSTEC and Mekong-Ganga Economic Corridor – a bridge between South and Southeast Asia.
Our ties with Japan – from economic to strategic – have been completely transformed.
It is a partnership of great substance and purpose that is a corner-stone of India’s Act East Policy.
There is a strong momentum in our cooperation with Republic of Korea.
And, there is a fresh energy in our partnerships with Australia, as also New Zealand.
With several of our partners, we meet in formats of three or more.
More than three years ago, I landed at dawn in Fiji to start a successful new phase of engagement with Pacific Island Nations.
The meetings of the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation, or FIPIC, have bridged the distance of geography through shared interests and action.
Beyond East and Southeast Asia, our partnerships are strong and growing.
It is a measure of our strategic autonomy that India’s Strategic Partnership, with Russia, has matured to be special and privileged.
Ten days ago in an informal summit at Sochi, President Putin and I shared our views on the need for a strong multi-polar world order for dealing with the challenges of our times.
At the same time, India’s global strategic partnership with the United States has overcome the hesitations of history and continues to deepen across the extraordinary breadth of our relationship.
It has assumed new significance in the changing world.
And, an important pillar of this partnership is our shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific Region.
No other relationship of India has as many layers as our relations with China.
We are the world’s two most populous countries and among the fastest growing major economies.
Our cooperation is expanding.
Trade is growing.
And, we have displayed maturity and wisdom in managing issues and ensuring a peaceful border.
In April, a two-day informal Summit with President Xi helped us cement our understanding that strong and stable relations between our two nations are an important factor for global peace and progress.
I firmly believe that, Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other’s interests.
At its core are cooperation based on Africa’s requirements, and a history of warmth and mutual respect.
We have more trade agreements in this part of the world than in any other.
We have Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements with Singapore, Japan and South Korea.
We have Free Trade Agreements with ASEAN and Thailand.
And, we are now actively participating in concluding the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.
I have just paid my first visit to Indonesia, India’s neighbour 90 nautical miles close, and not 90 nautical miles apart.
My friend President Widodo and I upgraded India-Indonesia relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
Among other shared interests, we have a common vision for maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.
India Armed Forces, especially our Navy, are building partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region for peace and security, as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
They train, exercise and conduct goodwill missions across the region.
For example, with Singapore, we have the longest un-interrupted naval exercise, which is in its twenty fifth year now.
We work with partners like Vietnam to build mutual capabilities.
India conducts Malabar Exercise with the United States and Japan.
A number of regional partners join in India’s Exercise Milan in the Indian Ocean, and participate in RIMPAC in the Pacific.
We are active in the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia – in this very city.
Distinguished members of the audience, Back home, our principal mission is transforming India to a New India by 2022, when Independent India will be 75 years young.
We will sustain growth of 7.5 to 8% per year.
As our economy grows, our global and regional integration will increase.
A nation of over 800 million youth knows that their future will be secured not just by the scale of India’s economy, but also by the depth of global engagement.
More than any where else, our ties will deepen and our presence will grow in the region.
But, the future we seek to build needs a stable bedrock of peace.
There are shifts in global power, change in the character of global economy and daily disruption in technology.
The foundations of the global order appear shaken.
Above all, we see assertion of power over re-course to international norms.
It is a world that summons us to rise above divisions and competition to work together.
Is that possible?
I see ASEAN as an example and inspiration.
ASEAN represents the greatest level of diversity of culture, religion, language, governance and prosperity of any grouping in the world.
It was born when Southeast Asia was a frontline of global competition, a theatre of a brutal war and a region of uncertain nations.
Yet, today, ASEAN has united ten countries behind a common purpose.
ASEAN unity is essential for a stable future for this region.
I have attended four East Asia Summits.
I am convinced that ASEAN can integrate the broader region.
In many ways, ASEAN is already leading the process.
In doing so, it has laid the foundation of the Indo-Pacific Region.
The East Asia Summit and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – two important initiatives of ASEAN – embrace this geography.
The Indo-Pacific is a natural region.
It is also home to a vast array of global opportunities and challenges.
I am increasingly convinced with each passing day that the destinies of those of us who live in the region are linked.
Today, we are being called to rise above divisions and competition to work together.
The ten countries of South East Asia connect the two great oceans in both the geographical and civilizational sense.
Inclusiveness, openness and ASEAN centrality and unity, therefore, lie at the heart of the new Indo-Pacific.
India does not see the Indo-Pacific Region as a strategy or as a club of limited members.
Nor as a grouping that seeks to dominate.
And by no means do we consider it as directed against any country.
And, it must equally apply to all individually as well as to the global commons.
Such an order must believe in sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as equality of all nations, irrespective of size and strength.
This is the foundation of India’s faith in multilateralism and regionalism; and, of our principled commitment to rule of law.
When we all agree to live by that code, our sea lanes will be pathways to prosperity and corridors of peace.
This region, and all of us, have benefitted from globalisation.
Indian food is among the best examples of these benefits!
But, there is growing protectionism – in goods and in services.
Solutions cannot be found behind walls of protection, but in embracing change.
What we seek is a level playing field for all.
India stands for open and stable international trade regime.
We understand the benefits of connectivity.
There are many connectivity initiatives in the region.
If these have to succeed, we must not only build infrastructure, we must also build bridges of trust.
And for that, these initiatives must be based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, consultation, good governance, transparency, viability and sustainability.
They must empower nations, not place them under impossible debt burden.
They must promote trade, not strategic competition.
On these principles, we are prepared to work with everyone.
Asia of cooperation will shape this century.
So, each nation must ask itself: Are its choices building a more united world, or forcing new divisions?
It is a responsibility that both existing and rising powers have.
Competition is normal.
Distinguished members of the audience, It is normal to have partnerships on the basis of shared values and interests.
India, too, has many in the region and beyond.
We will work with them, individually or in formats of three or more, for a stable and peaceful region.
But, our friendships are not alliances of containment.
We choose the side of principles and values, of peace and progress, not one side of a divide or the other.
Our relationships across the world speak for our position.
And, when we can work together, we will be able to meet the real challenges of our times.
We will be able to protect our planet.
We will be able to ensure non-proliferation We will be able to secure our people from terrorism and cyber threats.
In conclusion, let me say this again: India’s own engagement in the Indo-Pacific Region – from the shores of Africa to that of the Americas – will be inclusive.
We are in-heritors of Vedanta philosophy that believes in essential oneness of all, and celebrates unity in diversity Ekam Satyam, Viprah Bahudavadanti (Truth is one, the learned speak of it in many ways).
That is the foundation of our civilizational ethos – of pluralism, co-existence, open-ness and dialogue.
The ideals of democracy that define us as a nation also shape the way we engage the world.
So, we will engage with the world in peace, with respect, through dialogue and absolute commitment to international law.
We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order, in which all nations, small and large, thrive as equal and sovereign We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open; our nations secure from terrorism; and our cyber space free from disruption and conflict.
We will keep our economy open and our engagement transparent.
We will share our resources, markets and prosperity with our friends and partners.
We will seek a sustainable future for our planet, as through the new International Solar Alliance together with France and other partners.
This is how we wish ourselves and our partners to proceed in this vast region and beyond.
The ancient wisdom of the region is our common heritage.
Lord Buddha’s message of peace and compassion has connected us all.
Together, we have contributed much to human civilisation.
I am here to urge all to take that path.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi received a telephone call from US President, Mr. Barack Obama, on Tuesday, 8th December 2015.
The Prime Minister conveyed his condolences to President Obama on the loss of lives in the recent shooting incident in California.
The conversation focused on the ongoing Conference of Parties (CoP-21) in Paris.
Co-production of an Indian film with an international party means that Indian producer can access international funds and can collaborate on the script, talent and distribution at international level.
Co-production of a film under this treaty will qualify it to be national production both in India and Israel.
This will also enable a common pool of creative, artistic, technical, financial and marketing resources of the two countries.
The signing of the Film co-production agreement will lead to mutual exchange of art and culture, create goodwill and better understanding among the people of both the countries as well as various aspects of film making.
This is the way to success.”
“Your education should be an education of the heart and the spirit, and of the spirit as much of the brain; it should be a living connection between yourselves and your past as well as the modern world!”
An all party delegation from the State of Karnataka, led by Chief Minister Shri Siddaramaiah called on the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.
The delegation sought the Prime Minister’s intervention for an out-of-Tribunal settlement on the Mahadayi River water issue, which concerns the States of Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra.
The matter is currently before a Tribunal.
The Prime Minister suggested that a consensus in this regard would be necessary among various political parties in all three states, before an attempt can be made to resolve the matter through mutual consultations, out of the Tribunal.
The delegation raised the issue of severe drought in the State of Karnataka, especially in the northern parts of the State.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended the inauguration of the birth centenary celebration of Nanaji Deshmukh at IARI at Pusa in New Delhi.
The Prime Minister visited an exhibition on the theme “technology and rural life.”
The exhibition showcases good practices and applications, as well as schemes and initiatives of the Ministry of Rural Development.
He interacted with some innovators and beneficiaries.
The Prime Minister offered floral tributes to Nanaji Deshmukh and Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan.
He released a commemorative postage stamp on Nanaji Deshmukh.
As on date, integration of datasets of 41 programmes and schemes of 20 Ministries has been achieved on this Portal.
The App presently covers seven programs of the Ministry of Rural Development.
The Prime Minister said that Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan was never interested in power politics, and fought corruption.
Just having the best ideas for development are not enough, the Prime Minister said.
He added that initiatives have to be completed on time and the fruits of development must reach the intended beneficiaries.
Efforts have to be comprehensive and ‘outcome driven’, not ‘output driven’, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that facilities that are associated with cities must also be made available to our villages.
He said that the real essence of a democracy is Jan Bhagidari and integrating people in the development journey of cities, and villages.
Regular interaction with governments is required, he added.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the first Assembly of the International Solar Alliance at Vigyan Bhawan.

The Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, was present on the occasion.
Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that in the last 150 to 200 years, mankind has depended on fossil fuels for energy needs.
He said nature is now indicating that options such as solar, wind and water, offer more sustainable energy solutions.
In this context, he expressed confidence that in future, when people talk of organisations for the welfare of mankind established in the 21st century, the International Solar Alliance will be at the top of the list.
He said this is a great forum to work towards ensuring climate justice.
He said the International Solar Alliance could replace OPEC as the key global energy supplier in the future.
The Prime Minister said that the effect of increased use of renewable energy is now visible in India.
He added that India is working towards the goals of the Paris Agreement through an action plan.
He said that the target is to generate 40 percent of India’s total energy requirements in 2030, by non fossil fuel based sources.
He said India is developing with a new self-confidence of “Poverty to Power.”

Tan Sri Dato Dr Mohd Munir Abdul Majid, Chairman of the ASEAN Business Advisory Council,
I also congratulate you on the creation of One ASEAN Community which you are going to sign off tomorrow.
India and ASEAN are natural partners.
Our ties date back to ancient times.
They continue to serve as a bridge between our countries and regions.
I have been saying that the 21st century belongs to Asia.
I say this because of the track record of the ASEAN countries.
Together, ASEAN’s ten member countries form an economic powerhouse.
ASEAN has emerged as one of the largest economic zones in the world.
Last fifteen years have seen your rapid and yet stable growth.
Your Macro-economic stability has been the main reason for growth and stability in South East Asia.
With good governance, futuristic infrastructure and focus on new age technologies, you have created excellence.
In simple things like tourism, you have done miracles.
Once again, I compliment the leadership and people of ASEAN countries for what they have achieved.
When I analyse the Asian miracle, I find that small countries of ASEAN and a big country like China, both have done well.
This shows that growth depends more on the spirit of people rather than the size of population.
I have had personal relations with many leaders of this region.
I have also visited a number of places a number of times.
Even as Prime Minister, my engagements with the Asian leadership started as soon as I took over.
I met a number of ASEAN leaders in the last Summit too.
My government took office nearly 18 months ago.
The Indian economy faced serious challenges.
A high fiscal deficit, a high current account deficit, a large number of stalled infrastructure projects and persistent inflation were among them.
It was obvious that reforms were needed.
Is it just to increase the measured rate of GDP growth?
Or is it to bring about a transformation in society?
My answer is clear: we must REFORM TO TRANSFORM.
In short, reform is not an end in itself.
Reform for me is just a way station on the long journey to the destination.
The destination is the transformation of India.
We have to take the fruits of development to the margins of our geography and to the bottom of our demography.
We have to touch lives, while reaching for the sky.
By almost every major economic indicator, India is doing better than when we took office 18 months ago.
• GDP growth is up and inflation is down
• Foreign investment is up and the Current Account Deficit is down.
• Tax revenues are up and interest rates are down.
• The fiscal deficit is down and the rupee is stable.
Obviously, this did not happen by accident.
And the world economy is not exactly doing well.
This success is the result of a series of concerted policies.
We have embarked on a course of fiscal consolidation.
We have entered, for the first time, into a monetary framework agreement with the Reserve Bank to curb inflation.
Even while cutting the fiscal deficit, we have substantially increased productive public investment.
This has been made possible in two ways.
Firstly, we have imposed carbon taxes on fossil fuels.
We have taken the bold step of de-controlling diesel prices and thereby eliminated energy subsidies, and have in fact imposed taxes on fossil fuels.
We have increased the cess on coal by 300%.
Globally, there is much talk of carbon taxes.
We have actually acted.
Secondly, we have reduced wasteful expenditure through innovative methods including targeting subsidies to the deserving through technology.
Overall, there is increased confidence within and outside the country.
We have also introduced Soil Health Card.
This tells every farmer the condition of his or her soil and then enables him to choose the right crop, best quantity and mix of inputs.
We have launched a housing for all program, one of the most ambitious in the world.
It involves building 20 million urban houses and 29.5 million rural houses, totalling nearly 50 million.
While the programme will make sure no Indian is houseless, it will also generate a large amount of employment – that too, mainly for the unskilled, the semi-skilled and the poor.
We have undertaken major improvements in the transport sector.
Our major ports witnessed a 4.65% growth in traffic and an 11.2% increase in operating income, in 2014-15 despite a global contraction in trade volume.
The pace of award of new highway works has increased from 9 km/day in 2013-14 to 23 km/day currently.
These will have large multiplier effects throughout the economy.
We were committed to restore credibility in the process of allocation of natural resources.
My government has intervened with legislative and administrative measures to improve the supply of critical inputs and raw materials.
They include Coal, other minerals and spectrum.
The hallmark of this intervention is allocation through transparent auction.
We started the Jan Dhan Yojana.
In less than a year, we opened 190 million new bank accounts.
On Social security front, we have launched innovative and attractive schemes for insurance and pension.
We have also set up MUDRA Bank to fund the small traders who were unfunded so far.
More than six million small traders have already availed the loans.
While expanding the banking services, we are also taking steps to strengthen the Banking system.
These measures will also benefit our banks.
Let me now turn to issues of investment, which may be of more direct relevance to you.
In a break with over 65 years of tradition, we have involved India’s States in foreign policy.
The Ministry of External Affairs has been asked to work with the States.
• The sentiments for private investment and inflow of foreign investment have turned positive.
Foreign investment is up 40%.
• India has been consistently ranked as the most attractive investment destination by several global agencies and institutions.
• India has also jumped 16 places on the World Economic Forum’s global competitive index after five years of decline in the list.
• MOODY’s have upgraded the outlook for India.
To give you some examples:-
• We have allowed and enhanced FDI levels in key sectors including Insurance, Defence and Railways.
• Now, most of these FDI sectors have been put on automatic approval route.
• We have also rationalised FDI policies in many sectors, including construction, plantation and medical devices.
• We have now allowed composite caps for Foreign portfolio investors in all sectors where FDI is allowed.
Earlier, portfolio investments had a separate cap.
• We have greatly liberalised the licensing regime; to give you one example – we have taken out almost 60% of Defence items out of the licensing process.
• We have ended retrospective taxation.
• We have notified the regulations for the Alternative Investment Funds.
• We have rationalized capital gains tax for Real Estate Investment Trusts.
• We have also decided to defer the implementation of General Anti Avoidance Rules.
This will create a unified system of taxation across the country.
My Dear Countrymen, Namaskar!
This year the rains have started on a good note.
This will definitely prove beneficial to our farmer brothers and sisters in sowing of kharif crops.
I am very pleased to share an immensely good news with you all.
We have always faced scarcity of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
Poor people require pulses and some amount of oil to prepare vegetables for their food.
The intensity with which the farmers are connected with their land, our soldiers too are connected with the land in the same degree.
During the Kargil war, each one of our soldier proved mightier than hundreds of soldiers of our enemies.
I would like to salute all our brave soldiers who thwarted the attempts by our enemies without caring for their lives.
Kargil war was not limited to just our borders, but each of our cities, villages contributed in this war.
This war was fought by those mothers and sisters whose sons and brothers were fighting against the enemies at the border.
This war was also fought by the daughters of our country, who were newly married and their henna were still fresh on their hands.
It is because of these unmatchable sacrifices that our country is proudly standing on its feet in front of the entire world.
Hence, I would like to salute all these valiant warriors on this occasion of Kargil Vijay Diwas.
There is another reason why I consider 26th July quite important because MyGov.in was launched a few months after our government was formed.
One of the suggestions sent from Mr. Akhilesh Vajpayee from Kanpur is to provide separate quota to the disabled for booking tickets on IRCTC website.
It is quite unfair that the disabled citizens have to go through the same tiring procedure and buy tickets at the railway station.
Though this is a very minor issue but the government never took note of it or thought about the same previously.
But on the suggestion of our brother Akhilesh Vajpayee, our government looked into this suggestion seriously and we have implemented this facility in our system for our disabled brothers and sisters.
We are receiving quite positive suggestions on MyGov, it is helping in getting assistance in creating logos, tag-lines and formulating policies by yourselves.
We are experiencing fresh air in the administrative system.
We are experiencing a new sense of consciousness.
I am even receiving suggestion on MyGov that what should be my speech on 15th of August.
We have received quite a few suggestions from Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai in this regard.
She has suggested me to speak on the topics like Save our Daughters, Educate a Girl Child, Clean Ganges, Swachh Bharat.
Look, I believe that this will be a great initiative to include people’s suggestion in framing my speech for 15th August.
I believe that you will send your good suggestions.
He did not receive any help from the passers-by.
My heart shivers when I look at the statistics of accidents.
We are witnessing an accident every minute in our country.
Due to these road accidents we are witnessing one death every four minutes in our country.
The government system will continue to work towards this but I would like to request all the parents to make their children aware of all the Safety Rules pertaining to driving a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler – the families should encourage discussion of road safety at home and create an atmosphere about the same to promote road safety.
We have seen few lines written at the back of auto-rickshaws, “Papa, come home early” and after reading it we are so touched by it.
In the coming days, we are also planning to take many important measures for implementing National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
We have undertaken another project called Cashless Treatment in Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mundiya national highway and it will be further extended.
The Cashless Treatment refers to the policy for the first fifty hours post-accident – one need worry if one has money or not, who will pay the bills, leaving all this worry – one has to give primary importance to the road accident victim who is injured so that he is treated and provided the best hospital facilities at the earliest.
We have started a toll-free number 1033 for providing information about incidents across the country and ambulance service but all these are services are for post accidents.
I recalled a few incidents in the last few days which I liked and hence would like to share with you.
Vijay Biswal has shown us how we can connect our jobs with our hobbies, interests or skills.
Who knows, Vijay Biswal’s work may get recognised by his paintings across the nation in the near future.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, they are influencing all the brothers to gift toilet to their sisters, so that all the mothers and sisters of the district avoid going to toilet in the open.
There exists a small village called Keshla in Rajnandgaon, Chhattisgarh.
The inhabitants of this village from last few months tried and lead a campaign for building toilets in the village.
Now, nobody from this village has to go to toilet in the open.
These finest examples coming up to me show how our society is bringing change in human values and human mind and how the citizens of this country are taking the nation forward.
I would like to tell them with great pleasure that we have a separate ministry for North-Eastern region.
During the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee as our Prime Minister, a DONER Ministry called “Development of North-East Region” was formed.
After our government was formed, the DONER Department took an important decision of not staying in Delhi and working from centre for the North-East regions?
Instead it was decided to send the government officials and their team on a seven days camp to North-East states like Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim.
Such news remain in the flashlight for few moments and are gone.
I am often worried by this thought that we speak to the youth of our nation and ask about their dream job, only one out of 100 would express their interest in becoming a scientist.
Youth is losing their interest in science, which is a matter of great concern.
Science and Technology is a type of DNA for development.
Ministry of Human Resource Development, Govt. of India has initiated a National Discovery Campaign.
It was inaugurated by India’s ex-President Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam.
As a part of this campaign, IIT, NIT, Central and State Universities being their mentor and guide are going to educate and motivate the aspiring students to choose the right path in their career.
The students of the villages should not be affected with the shortage of electricity during their exams.
There should be enough electricity for starting a small industry.
Today, the villagers have to go to other villagers for charging their mobile phones.
We have to run for the development of the Poor.
We will achieve this goal and it is already in progress.
We will certainly achieve this.
Today, through Mann ki Baat, I felt like expressing these myriad of thoughts.
In a way, in our country the months of August and September are the months for celebration of festivals.
There are lots of festivals in these months.
My greetings to all of you for the same.
Please do send your suggestions for 15th August.
Your opinions will really help me.
Thank you very much to you all!

My friend President Macri and all the distinguished guests from Argentina,
Greetings, (Namaskar)
I warmly welcome Mr. President, his family and the delegation.
It is a matter of great pleasure that two months after our meeting in Buenos Aires, I have this opportunity to welcome you today in India.
On this occasion, I once again congratulate President Macri and his team for the efficient and successful hosting of the G-20 Summit in 2018.
The leadership of President Macri was important for the successful hosting of the Summit.
During the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires President Macri made the pleasant announcement that during the 75th year of India’s independence in 2022 India will be hosting the G20 Summit.
For this I am thankful to him.
My fifth meeting with President Macri today reflects the fast and growing importance of bilateral engagement between the two countries.
We have proved that the distance of 15,000 kilometers between the two countries is just a number.
But the mutual relations of our people is older than this.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had traveled to Argentina in 1924.
The immense effect of that journey has become immortal through his creations.
Considering our shared values and our interests to promote peace, stability, economic progress and prosperity both the countries have given their relations the status of a strategic partnership.
I and President Macri agree that terrorism is a very serious threat to global peace and stability.
The brutal terrorist attack in Pulwama shows that the time for discussions is over now.
Now the whole world unitedly needs to take concrete steps against terrorism and its supporters.
Hesitating to act against terrorists and their anti-humanitarian supporters is also equivalent to promoting terrorism.
As the G-20 countries, it is also important that we implement the 11-point agenda of ‘Hamburg Leaders’ Statement’ on countering terrorism.
In this regard it is important that, we, both the countries are issuing a special declaration against terrorism after our discussions today.
Our cooperation in the field of space and peaceful use of nuclear energy is continuously increasing.
The Memorandum of Understanding signed today in respect of Defense Cooperation will give a new dimension to our cooperation in the defense sector.
India and Argentina are complementary to each other in many ways.
It is our endeavor to take full advantage of this for our mutual benefit.
Argentina is the powerhouse of agriculture.
India sees it as an important partner for its food security.
The work-plan of Agro-Industrial Cooperation between us today is an important step in this direction.
Our joint venture ‘KABIL’ has started discussions with Argentina for cooperation in the mining sector.
In the last 10 years, our bilateral trade has more than doubled and have become in excess of US $ 3 billion.
There are possibilities for significant increase in many sectors such as agriculture, metals and minerals, oils and gas, pharmaceutical, chemicals, motor vehicles and services.
Today we have identified specific methods to enhance our commercial engagement.
I am glad that representatives from many important Argentine companies have come with President Macri.
I am confident that his talks with business leaders in Delhi and Mumbai will be useful.
There are millions of fans of Indian art, culture and spirituality in Argentina.
Argentina’s Tango dance and football is very popular in India.
India and Argentina have good cooperation in international forums.
For global peace and security and economic and social advancement of all people we accept the need of reformed multilateralism.
South-South Cooperation holds great importance for us.
I am happy to say that India will actively participate in the second high level conference of United Nations on South-South Cooperation in Buenos Aires in 2019.
Our views are similar in the fight against climate change.
I am very happy to welcome Argentina as a new member in the International Solar Alliance (ISA).
I once again express my gratitude for accepting my invitation to visit India.
I hope that this journey is enjoyable for you and your family.

Sisters and brothers of Kerala,
I feel blessed to be visiting God’s own country.
In Kollam, on the banks of the Ashtamudilake, I sense recovery from the floods of last year.
But we have to work harder to rebuild Kerala.
Ease of living for the people is the commitment of my government.
We believe in sabkasaath, sabkavikas.
With this commitment, my government gave the final sanction to this project in January 2015.
I am happy that with contribution and co-operation of state government, we have completed the project in an effective manner.
Since May 2014, when my Government took over, we have given top priority to develop infrastructure in Kerala.
Under Bharatmala a detailed project report for Mumbai Kanyakumari Corridor is under preparation.
Many such projects are in various such stages of development.
In our country, we have often seen that infrastructure projects get stalled after announcement for various reasons.
A lot of public money is wasted due to cost and time over-runs.
We decided that this culture of wastage of public money cannot continue.
Through PRAGATI, we are accelerating projects and overcoming this problem.
On the last Wednesday of every month, I sit with all secretaries of government of India and chief secretaries of state governments and review such delayed projects.
It is a crime to deprive the common man of the benefits of a project or a scheme for such a long time.
Till now, I have reviewed more than 250 projects worth about 12 lakh crore rupees under PRAGATI.
From national highways to rural roads, pace of construction has almost doubled as compared to the previous government.
When we formed government, only 56% of rural habitations were connected by a road.
Today more than 90% of rural habitations are connected by a road.
I am sure that we will definitely achieve the target of 100% soon.
As in road sector my government has given priority to railways, waterways and airways.
National waterway from Varanasi to Haldia has already started.
It will ensure a clean mode of transportation and will preserve the environment for future generations.
Regional air connectivity has also improved immensely in last four years.
The rate of doubling electrification and laying of new tracks has shown big improvement.
All this is also leading to increase in job creation.
My commitment is for the development of each of my countrymen.
The last man in the queue is my priority.
My government has sanctioned a new fund of 7,5 00 crore rupees for the fisheries sector.
Under Ayushman Bharat, we are providing cashless health assurance to the tune of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year, for the poor.
More than 8 lakh patients have taken benefit of this scheme so far.
The government has sanctioned more than 1,100 crores rupees till now.
My government has worked hard in tourism sector and results are outstanding.
India has been ranked at third place in the new Power Ranking in the 2018 report of the World Travel & Tourism Council.
This is a major development that augurs well for the entire tourism sector in the country.
India’s ranking in the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index of the World Economic Forum moved from 65th position to 40th position.
Foreign tourist arrivals in India went up from around 70 lakh in 2013 to about 1 crore in 2017.
That is a 42% increase!The foreign exchange earned by India due to tourism went up from 18 billion dollars in 2013 to 27 billion dollars in 2017!
Introduction of the e-Visa has been a game changer for Indian Tourism.
This facility is now available to nationals of 166 countries worldwide.
Recognizing the tourism potential of Kerala we have sanctioned 7 projects in the State under the Swadesh Darshan and PRASAD schemes for an approximate amount of Rs. 550 crore.
Later today, I will inaugurate one such project at Sree Padmanabhaswamy
Temple in Thiruvananthapuram.I will also seek blessings from Lord Padmanabhaswamy for the welfare of people of Kerala and other parts of the country.
I have heard of the phrase “Kollam kandalillamvenda” which means once in Kollam, one never misses home.
I also share the same feeling.
I thank people of Kollam and Kerala for their love and affection.
I pray for a developed and strong Kerala.
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the passing away of Shri Balram Jakhar.

The Prime Minister also performed Ganga Pujan, and visited the Swachh Kumbh Exhibition.
He visited the Akshay Vat in Prayagraj.
He said the new airport terminal had been completed in a record time of one year.

He said the effort is to showcase India’s glorious past, and vibrant future.
He said the Ardh-Kumbh would show how ‘New India’ encompasses both heritage and modernity.
The Prime Minister said that he wishes to caution the country that certain forces are trying to put undue pressure on the judiciary.
First of all, I congratulate the newly elected deputy chairman Shriman HarivanshJi on behalf the entire house and myself.
It is a matter of happiness for all of us that today Arun Ji is also amongst us after the recovery.
Today is the 9thof August.
The August Revolution was an important milestone in the freedom movement and Balia district had played an important role in that event.
Whether it was Mangal Pandey Ji or Chittu Pandey Ji or be it the tradition of Chandra ShekharJi, and HarivanshJi is also in that series.
He was born in the village of Jay Prakash Ji and till date he has been attached to the village.
And he has also been working as a trustee in the trust that was formed for implementing the dreams of Jay Prakash Ji.
HarivanshJi belongs that tradition of Wordsmiths who have built a special recognition for themselves.
And it is a matter of happiness for me that he had been a student in Banaras.
He obtained education in Banaras.
And he completed his M.A. in economics from Banaras only.
And he was selected in the Reserve Bank.
However, he did not opt for the Reserve Bank.
He worked with SP Singh.
And as a trainee journalist he had worked with DharamvirBharati.
However, he never let his own newspaper get an idea of it that Chandra ShekharJi was about to resign.
While maintaining the dignity of his office he kept that secret to himself.
He did not allow the news to be published in his own newspaper so that the newspaper can win praise.
HarivanshJi joined Ravivar newspaper in Bihar.
At that time it was undivided Bihar, Jharkhand was formed later.
The person who had several opportunities in life, there were avenues if he had gone to the banking sector.
However, he was a talented person and he dedicated himself to a newspaper with a circulation of just 400 copies.
He reasoned with them and secured the release of the person.
You have shown the example of a successful tenure as a member of parliament to everyone.
However, most of the time the situation of the house is like this that umpires are in more trouble than the players.
Therefore, it is a huge task, it is a challenging task to compel everyone to play by the rules.
However, HarivanshJi will certainly be able to do this thing.
HarivanshJi’s wife Shrimati Asha Ji, she is from Champaran.
It was such an election in whichthere were candidates with ‘Hari’ name on either side.
One candidate has a prefix of BK before his name: BK Hari.
He has no such prefix or suffix of BK or VK.
So a lot of new people would have received the training for casting votes.
And I would like to thank all the dignitaries, all the honorable members for taking forward this entire process in a very good manner and also to the deputy chairman.
And I am confident that his experience, his dedication to the social cause.And it has been an unique thing about HarivanshJi, he had started a column in his news paper: ‘What kind of MP should we have?’
And at that time he did not know that one day he would become MP.
But he had run a massive campaign that what kind of MPs we should have.
So today we are going to be guided by the gentleman manwho has always been attached to the people at the bottom of the society.

I see you are having a good time.
I know that I stand between you and Cold Play and so will make this brief.
Back in 2014, I had enjoyed attending the Global Citizen Festival in the beautiful Central Park of New York.
However, this time around, my schedule did not permit me to come in person.
But then, I just could not miss out on the first time this was happening in India.
So here I am on V C
Many of you have already connected with me over my Mobile App.
I look forward to your feedback and suggestions in the future as well.
I always look forward to being among young people.
It refreshes and re-energizes me.
You bring an Energy and Idealism that is unparalleled.
I can feel it now, even when I am hundreds of kilometres away from you.
This is a welcome break from my usual routine of old files and cold Delhi.
You have been smart in asking me to only address the gathering, and not sing.
My dear young friends, on the whole, I am convinced that we can, and we will build a Swachh Bharat, free of all forms of filth within one generation.
I also know that we will surely do so, the moment You decide to do so.
Hence, I am deeply grateful for your walking shoulder to shoulder with me in this Cleanliness drive, and look forward to your continuing to do the same.
But, you will perhaps be more familiar with Bob Dylan, Norah Jones, Chris Martin and A.R. Rahman.
So to quote from one of Dylan’s transformative anthems which holds as much meaning today as it did when it was first sung in the 1960s.
Your old road is rapidly aging
Elders must learn from these words of wisdom.
We better get out of the way, as indeed, the times they are a changing.
And our Future is built on the Choices YOU Make, and the Actions YOU Take.
Hence, I hope YOU too will seize the moment and be the winds of change that are transforming our nation.
Because, as Chris has said in his songs.
You can see the change you want to
Be what you want to be
Everything you want is a dream away
Under this pressure under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing of new Air Services Agreement (ASA) between India and Fiji.

This is yet another giant step in Afghanistan’s march to progress.
And, it is a historic moment of emotion and pride in the relations between Afghanistan and India.
Thank you, Mr. President, for your invitation and for naming this dam as Afghanistan-India Friendship Dam.
We are truly humbled by the generosity of the Afghan spirit.
Rivers have been bearers of great civilisations of the world.
In the flow of rivers runs the course of human progress.
In the Holy Quran, river is central to the image of Paradise.
In the ancient scriptures of India, rivers defined our nation and were celebrated as the giver of life.
The dam is a generator not just of electricity but also of optimism and belief in the future of Afghanistan.
The lost decades speak to us about the ravages of a long drawn war.
It was a war not of Afghan making, but it was one that stole the future of an entire generation of Afghans.
And, when a new dawn broke over Afghanistan in 2001, we resumed the project.
The fields that produce the finest fruits and saffron shall once again come alive with the clear waters of the river.
The homes that lived through dark nights of dread will now be lit by the power of hope.
Children shall again believe in the possibility of a future of education and opportunity.
And, another young girl poet will not have to live a life of pain, denial and longing, or see a life of promise cut short.
Herat has time and again seen sublime glory and tragic ruin.
And, the city that once Jalaluddin Rumi held as the finest, will rise again.
The city that was the gateway to the West, South and Central Asia,will once again be the hub that will unite the regions in a peaceful pursuit of prosperity.
For many, the Harirud River is one strand of our connected histories since the ancient Vedic times.
Today, the world will see the Harirud River as an abiding emblem of our commitment to a shared future of progress.
And, the Friendship Dam unites us in solidarity as Chishti Sharif joined us in spirit centuries ago.
For, it is from here that the Chishti Silsila or Chishti tradition of Sufism came to India.
Its glorious tradition and teachings resonate through the dargahs of Ajmer, Delhi and Fatehpur Sikri.
Afghans have pursued this path, despite the strength of their belief that they can defend their freedom like no other people on this earth.
And, it is on the foundation of these values that Afghans and Indians seek each other, not because they harbour designs against another.
Khwaja Moiunuddin Chishti, the first of the Chishti saints in India, said that human beings must have the affection of the sun, the generosity of the river and the hospitality of the earth.
In your clear eyes, I saw the deep well of affection for India.
In your smiles, I saw the joy of this relationship.
In the firmness of your embrace, I felt the trust in our friendship.
And, in those memorable hours, India witnessed once again the grace of your people, the beauty of this land and the friendship of a nation.
Today, I return with the gratitude and admiration of 1.25 billion people.
And, a renewed pledge for our partnership.
Together, our partnership has built schools, health centres and irrigation facilities for rural communities.
It has empowered women with skills and the youth with the education to shoulder the responsibility for Afghanistan’s future.
Now, India’s investment in the port at Chahbahar in Iran will give Afghanistan a new route to the world and a new path to prosperity.
And, to implement that vision,just last month, President Ghani joined President Rouhani of Iran and me in witnessing the signing of the Chahbahar Trade and Transit Agreement between Afghanistan, Iran and India.
Our cooperation will extend to every part of Afghanistan.
Our partnership will benefit every section of Afghan society.
Because across its difficult geography, and across its diversity, and beyond the identities as Pushtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras, Afghanistan must live and prosper as one.
For, divisions among Afghan people will only help those who seek to dominate the nation from outside.
As we work together, we draw strength and confidence from your deep commitment to protect our partnership from the designs of others.
When our people are under attack, the brave Afghans guard us as their own.
They put themselves in the line of fire so that their Indian friends are safe.
This is the nobility of your heart and the strength of your friendship.
I have seen this from the moment I assumed office as Prime Minister.
Mr. President, Friends,
Afghanistan’s success is a deeply held hope and desire of every Indian.
It comes from the love and admiration for Afghans in our hearts.
We want to see your democracy strike deep roots; your people unite; and, your economy prosper.
We want to see your art, culture and poetry thrive.
And, we want to see your cricketers join the ranks of test players and also seek glory in IPL.
But, it also comes from the recognition that when Afghanistan succeeds, the world will be safer and more beautiful.
When the values that define Afghans prevail, terrorism and extremism will be in retreat.
Because we know that extremism and terrorism cannot stop at your border or end at the boundaries of our region.
So, in the spreading unrest of our times, the world cannot forget the brave struggle that the Afghan people are waging – for themselves and our world.
India will not forget or turn away.
Our resources may be modest, but our will is boundless.
For others, their commitments may have a sunset clause, but our relationship is timeless.
So, on international platforms and in regional forums, we will speak in one voice for the Afghan right to a peaceful, prosperous, united, inclusive and democratic nation.
And, in the fields, villages and cities of Afghanistan, we will work together for that future.

He urged the Chief Secretaries to use the district administration in this regard, so that small traders are facilitated to access and adopt the new system.
He reiterated that small businesses must register with the GST network, to take advantage of business opportunities.
He said that the common man and the trader must benefit from this path breaking decision.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.
Your Excellency Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth
It gives me great pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth and his delegation to India.
Our bonds have flourished despite time and distance.
Today, they weave a rich tapestry of friendship in diverse areas.
My discussions with Prime Minister Jugnauth have been warm and productive.
Our conversation reminded me of my own memorable visit to Mauritius in March 2015.
That visit, which was my first to the Indian Ocean region, gave us a robust agenda for cooperation.
It also underscored the commonality of our values, interests and efforts.
Today, we have taken another leap in our bilateral agenda.
As frontline states of the Indian Ocean, Prime Minister Jugnauth and I agree that it is our responsibility to ensure collective maritime security around our coasts and in our EEZs.
We agree that effective management of conventional and non-conventional threats in the Indian Ocean is essential to pursue economic opportunities; protect the livelihood of our communities, and provide security to our people.
And, for this India-Mauritius cooperation is very very important.
We have to keep up our vigil against :
• Piracy that impacts trade and tourism;
• Trafficking of drugs and humans;
• Illegal fishing, and
• Other forms of illegal exploitation of marine resources
The conclusion of the bilateral Maritime Security Agreement today, will strengthen our mutual cooperation and capacities.
We have also agreed to further strengthen our wide-ranging cooperation in hydrography for a secure and peaceful maritime domain.
India is supporting the National Coast Guard of Mauritius in augmenting its capacity through Project Trident.
A strong developmental partnership with Mauritius is a hallmark of our engagement.
India is proud to participate actively in the ongoing development activities in Mauritius.
Prime Minister Jugnauth and I welcome the progress in ongoing projects.
India will extend full support for the timely execution of projects identified between our countries.
Projects that will vitalize the economy of Mauritius and mark a qualitative transformation in our relations.
In our discussions, we also focused on increasing skill development cooperation with Mauritius.
It is an active part of our present interaction under India’s multiple capacity building programme with Mauritius.
We are happy to further deepen our exchanges in this domain.
We applaud the leadership shown by Prime Minister Jugnauth in drawing attention to the importance of renewable energy.
The signing and ratification of the framework agreement on International Solar Alliance by Mauritius has opened up new vistas of regional partnership for both countries in this field.
We take pride in this contribution of the Indian-origin community to the national life of Mauritius.
To promote our thriving links with the diaspora in Mauritius, India had, in January this year, declared a special carve-out on OCI cards only for Mauritius.
Our flag carrier airlines have agreed to enhance their code sharing arrangement to new destinations.
This too is expected to lead to greater tourism and people-to-people contacts between our countries.
Apart from bilateral issues, Prime Minister Jugnauth and I also exchanged views on a range of regional and global issues.
We agreed to continue supporting each other in multilateral fora and cooperate closely on our common challenges and interests.
Prime Minister Jugnauth’s visit will contribute to elevating our relationship to new heights on the bed-rock of our traditional links.
I thank Prime Minister Jugnauth for his vision and support to our relationship.
And I look forward to working closely with him in the coming months as we put into action the decisions we have taken today.
Further, the scheme also caters to Hydro-meteorological observations and Flood Forecasting on common rivers with the neighbouring countries.
Just a while ago, from the 4th of April to the 15th of April, the 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia.
71 countries, including India, participated therein.
With an event of such scale & magnitude, which saw the participation of thousands of sportspersons from myriad corners of the world, can you imagine the mood that must have pervaded the atmosphere there?
An air of excitement, zeal, enthusiasm, hope, aspirations, the determination to achieve – who would want to stay away from an atmosphere like that?
These were the times when people all over the country pondered eagerly everyday on the line-up of sportspersons, scheduled for their respective performances.
Our sportspersons too lived up to the countrymen’s expectations and displayed stellar performances, winning one medal after another.
Shooting or Wrestling, Table Tennis or Badminton, it was a record performance for India.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze, India bagged a tally of around 66 medals.
This success makes every Indian swell with pride.
Of course, winning medals is a moment of joy & glory for a sportsperson; it is equally so as a festival of laurels for the country & her countrymen.
They have reached this pinnacle, crossing a great deal of hurdles and hardships.
Today, the positions they have secured for themselves, the targets they have achieved, owes a lot to the efforts & contribution of their parents, guardians, coaches, support staff, schools, teachers, the atmosphere provided by their Schools, during this journey in their lives.
Even their friends have contributed by boosting their morale under all circumstances.
I also congratulate them along with the sportspersons, my good wishes to them.
Last month during ‘Mann Ki Baat’, I had urged our countrymen, especially the youth to espouse ‘Fit India’.
Expressing support for this, many people have written to me, sent me letters, shared ‘fitness mantra- Fit India’ stories on social media.
A gentleman Shriman Shashikant Bhonsale, sharing his photo by the swimming pool, has written, ‘My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming’.
Rooma Devnath writes, “I truly feel happy & healthy through my Morning Walks.
Devnathji, indeed, happiness is fitness, and there’s no doubt about it.
It was heartening to see many eminent personalities encouraging our youth in interesting ways for Fit India.
Cine artiste Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
He has mentioned that this exercise benefits muscles of the back and the stomach, to a great extent.
Another video of his has gained popularity; in this he’s trying his hand on the volleyball with others.
Many other young people have shared their experiences, having joined the ‘Fit India’ efforts.
I feel movements like these are beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
I would additionally like to mention, that the movement of ‘Fit India’, without any expense, is called ‘YOG’.
Yog has a special significance in the ‘Fit India’ campaign.
Nowadays, the benefits of yog in one’s holistic physical & mental development does not need to be told… neither in India nor elsewhere in the world.
One gets an opportunity to experience life anew, away from closeted walls, away from paper & pen and computers.
Even the cause of the cleanliness campaign will get a boost, and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we’ll surely attain a sense of fulfillment.
Once again, I invite students & young people, boys & girls to avail of the benefits of the internship.
You can register yourselves for the ‘Swachch Bharat Summer Internship’ on Mygov.
I hope our youth will lend a hand in taking this movement of cleanliness forward.
I too am eager to know more about your efforts.
Let us turn this vacation into a learning opportunity, for a totally new experience.
Initially, shocked to see the condition of children begging around or doing some menial jobs that this group of youngsters got dedicatedly, selflessly involved into this creative mission.
Starting with just 15 children from the slums near Geeta Colony in New Delhi it is now being run at 12 places and two thousand children have been brought under its fold.
Young teachers associated with this campaign find out a free time of two hours from their busy schedule and contribute in this stupendous mission of bringing out a social transformation.
Dear brothers and sisters, in this very way, some farmers from hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
With their collective efforts, they have not only changed their own fortunes but have changed fortunes of the whole region.
Besides, there is a strong belief that the land in this area is iron-rich and these iron rich biscuits are very good for pregnant women as they overcome the deficiency of iron.
These farmers have formed a cooperative society in Munar village and set-up a biscuit factory there.
Impressed by the bold initiative of these farmers, the administration has also linked this to the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being supplied upto Almora and Kousani besides being sold to about fifty Aanganwadi kendras in Bagheshwar district.
My dear countrymen, we often hear that in, times to come, the world will face a war because of water.
Everyone talks about this but do we not have any responsibility towards conservation of water?
Our forefathers have lived this as a way of life for centuries together.
They gave due priority and importance to each single drop of water.
They found out newer methods in order to conserve every single drop of water.
Several baodis (stepwells) are famous as tourist spots but please do not forget that these are the living symbols of the water conservation campaigns which our forefathers had accomplished.
If you happen to go to Rajasthan, you must visit Chand Baodi.
April, May, June and July is the most suitable time when rain water harvesting can be done and if we make preparations in advance, we can reap a rich harvest.
Budget under MNREGA is also utilized for this water conservation activity.
During the last three years, everyone in his or her own way has contributed towards water conservation and water management.
An average of 32,000 crore rupees have been spent besides the MNREGA budget each year on water conservation and water management.
If we talk of 2017-18, 55 percent of the total outlay of Rupees 64 thousand crores, which comes to around rupees 35 thousand crores, has been spent on works like water conservation.
In last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land got more benefit through water conservation and water management measures.
Some people have really benefitted very well from MNREGA budget provisions made by the Government of India for water conservation and water management works.
Rabindra Nath was a personality full of talent, a multi – directional personna but a teacher in his inner self can always be felt.
And, whenever I got a chance to listen to poems like Anandloke and Aaguner, Poroshmoni, I used to feel as if my mind was being energised.
You must also have been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.
The sociological and collective aspect of fasting is that when a person experiences hunger himself, he comes to realize the hunger of others.
When he is thirsty, he realizes the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings of Prophet Muhammad-peace be upon him- and his message.
It is our responsibility to follow the path of equality and brotherhood as morals from his life.
Once a person asked the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Which is the best thing in Islam?”
The Prophet Saab said, “feeding a poor and needy and meeting everyone cordially, whether you know him or not!”
Prophet Mohammad Sahib (peace be upon him) believed in twin principles of knowledge and compassion.
He did not possess an iota of ego regarding himself.
He preached that knowledge alone defeats ego.
Prophet Mohammad Sahib(peace be upon him) believed that if you possessed anything more than your requirement, then donate it to the needy, thus donation or giving alms is important during Ramzan.
People donate generously to the needy during this holy month.
We must be proud of the fact that India is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, the very synonym of power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of all of our obligation to emulate Lord Buddha’s teaching as well as, pledge ourselves to follow his footsteps.
Lord Buddha was the fountainhead of egalitarianism, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are human values, which are most desired in the world today.
Baba Saheb strengthened the oppressed, exploited, deprived and crores of people standing on the brink of marginalization via the Constitution of India.
There cannot be a bigger example of compassion than this.
This form of compassion was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha for the alleviation of suffering of the people.
We have inherited the wisdom of Lord Buddha throughout Asia as part of our legacy.
I wish people spread all over the world who revere Lord Buddha and believe in the principles of compassion- I wish all of them an auspicious Buddha Purnima.
Now you will be wondering what is the connection between smiling Buddha and India’s military might?
The Indian diaspora was infused with new confidence.
That day also was the day of Buddha Purnima.
India’s test was not only successful but in a way, India had demonstrated its might in the field of science and technology.
We can also say 11 May 1988 is engraved in the history of India as a demonstration of her military power.
Lord Buddha has shown the world- that the power of inner strength or that of the soul is necessary for peace.
Similarly, when you are sturdy as a nation, you can be at peace with others.
The month of May, 1998 is not just important for the country from the aspect that nuclear tests were conducted this very month, but the manner in which they were carried out is also important.
It has revealed to the entire world that India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can reach loftier destinations and earn new laurels.
On that day, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra – “Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan, Jai-Vigyan.’
Synergize your energy with the strength of India.
Witnessing the journey that Atal ji started, we while continuing onwards on that very path with a renewed joy will derive great satisfaction in getting ahead.
My dear countrymen, looking forward to our conversation when we will meet for another episode of Mann Ki Baat.

PM added that till date both UTs had only 15 Medical seats in a year and with the setting up of this Medical College , 150 seats will be available now.
He said Medical College will provide improved medical facilities to the people.
Speaking on Ayushman Bharat, he said it is the World’s biggest Heathcare Project and everyday 10 thousand poors are accessing the benefits of this scheme.
In just 100 days since its inception over 7 lakh poor patients have been benefited.
He said that Under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, a massive campaign to provide a permanent house to the poors in cities and villages is underway.
Prime Minister also underlined that in Dadra and Nagar Haveli alone , 13000 women have been provided Free Gas Connections.
He said efforts are being taken to ensure welfare of the tribal people.
The revival of India-UK CEO Forum is a welcome step.
It is not just a call for economic inclusion.
It is also a celebration of our diversity; the creed for social harmony; and, a commitment to individual liberties and rights.
This is the timeless ethos of our culture; this is the basis of our constitution; and, this will be the foundation of our future.”
The Prime Minister addressed the business community of the City of London, at Guildhall.
The #Sandesh2Soldiers campaign gives every citizen an opportunity to spread happiness and cheer among the Indian Armed Forces, who are guarding our nation’s frontiers, far from their loved ones on Diwali.
A holistic campaign has been launched to urge and invite people to send letters and messages to the Armed Forces.
Leading this effort, the Prime Minister shared through social media, a special video, featuring his appeal to the people to send messages to our brave Armed Forces personnel.
Within hours, the video has generated tremendous interest on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.
People can send messages to soldiers on the Narendra Modi App, through MyGov.in, and also through All India Radio.
Doordarshan shall also be mounting a programme to share people’s emotions with the Armed Forces.
A special module has been launched on the Narendra Modi App, which enables people to send greetings or their hand-written messages to the Armed Forces.
The #Sandesh2Soldiers campaign is expected to generate increased interaction between the people and the Armed Forces.
Earlier this month, at an event in Bhopal, the Prime Minister had focused on the human element of our brave jawans.

The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved an ex- gratia of Rs. 2 lakh each from Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund for the next of kin of those who have lost their lives due to dust storm in various states of Northern India on 2nd May 2018.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has greeted citizens on National Technology Day.
“Greetings to our citizens on National Technology Day.
Best wishes to all citizens, especially our outstanding scientists and technology enthusiasts on National Technology Day.
In everything associated with it like cuisine or attire, traditional norms are adhered to.
The unique festival Chhath Pooja is deeply linked with nature & worshiping nature.
Surya & Jal –The Sun & Water are central to the veneration in Chhath, whereas utensils made of bamboo & clay and tubers are an essential part of the Pooja articles.
In this mega festival of faith, veneration of the rising sun and worship of the setting sun convey a message that is replete with unparalleled Sanskar.
But in Chhath Pooja, it is specially customary to ask for Prasad after the morning Arghya ritual.
It is believed that the rationale behind this tradition is that, it destroys his ego that proves to be an impediment in one’s path of progress.
It is natural for each one of us to feel proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, ‘Mann – Ki – Baat’ has garnered accolades; it has also attracted criticism.
But whenever I look at the overall outcome of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, it reinforces my belief, that it is intrinsically, inseparably woven into the warp & weft of our common citizens’ lives, cent per cent.
Take the examples of Khadi and handloom.
On Gandhi Jayanti I have always advocated the use of handloom and Khadi.
What has it led to?
You will be glad to know that on the 17th of this month on the day of Dhanteras, the Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan store in Delhi witnessed a record sale of Rupees one crore, twenty lakhs.
You too must be feeling happy with a sense of satisfaction at this mega sale in just one Khadi & Handloom store.
During Diwali, Khadi gift coupon sales recorded an overwhelming 680 per cent rise.
Compared to last year, the total sales of Khadi & Handicrafts have risen almost by 90%.
One can clearly see that today, the youth, the elderly, women, in fact every age group is taking to Khadi & handloom.
Khadi and handloom have transformed the lives of the poorest of the poor and are emerging as a powerful means of empowering them.
It is playing a very important role for gramodaya.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written on NarendramodiApp that he wants to know about my experience of celebrating Diwali with security forces and he also wants to know how the security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwad has also written on NarendramodiApp whether there could be an arrangement to send our homemade sweets to the security forces.
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that our homemade sweets must reach our country’s soldiers.
All of you must have celebrated Deepawali with traditional fervour.
To me, Diwali brought a special experience.
Luckily I got another chance to celebrate Deepawali with our courageous and brave heart security personnel.
Memories of Diwali celebrations with our security forces in Gurez sector of Jammu & Kashmir will stay long cherished in my heart.
On behalf of all our countrymen, I salute every soldier of our security forces who guard the country’s borders with utmost dedication and a spirit of sacrifice, braving all odds.
Whenever we get a chance or whenever there is an opportunity we must try to know the experiences of our soldiers and listen to their tales of valour.
Many of us may not be aware that the jawans of our security forces play an important role not only on our borders but they play a very vital role in establishing peace the world over.
As UN Peacekeepers, they are bringing glory to the nation in the comity of nations.
United Nations Day was observed recently all over the world on the 24th of October.
Everybody recalls the efforts and constructive role of the UN in establishing peace throughout the world.
And, we are believers in “Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam” which means the whole world is our family.
And with this belief, India has been cooperating very actively in various important initiatives taken by the UN.
You may be aware that the preface of the Indian Constitution and the preface of the UN Charter; both start with the words ‘We the people’.
India has always stressed on the importance of equality for women and the UN Declaration of Human Rights is a living example of this.
India’s most important contribution under the UN umbrella is its role in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
India has always been extending active support to UN Peace Missions.
Many of you may be getting to know this for the first time.
More than 18 thousand Indian security personnel have lent their services in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
Presently, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN Peacekeeping initiatives which is the third highest number of soldiers from any country.
Till August 2017, Indian soldiers had lent their services in about 50 of the total of 71 Peacekeeping operations undertaken by the UN the world over.
These operations have been carried out in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and many other parts of the world.
In Congo and Southern Sudan more than twenty thousand patients were treated in hospitals of the Indian army and countless lives were saved.
Indian security forces have not only saved people in various countries but also won their hearts with their people friendly operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peace keeping efforts.
Later, all countries started sending their women police units.
You will surely feel proud to know that India’s contribution is not limited to just peacekeeping operations but it is also providing training to peacekeepers from about eighty five countries.
The brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Budha have sent a message of peace and amity around the world.
Peacekeeping operation is not an easy task.
Jawans from our security forces have to perform duties in difficult and remote areas.
Every Indian feels proud while remembering him.
He was the only UN peacekeeper, a brave-heart, who was awarded the Param Veer Chakra.
Lieutenant General Prem Chand ji is one among those Indian Peacekeepers who carved a special niche for themselves in Cyprus.
General Thimaiyya, who had been India’s army chief, lead the UN Peacekeeping force in Cyprus and sacrificed everything for those peace efforts.
India has always been giving a message of peace, unity and harmony to the world.
We believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move ahead to carve a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our holy land has given great souls who selflessly served humanity.
Sister Nivedita, whom we also know as Bhagini Nivedita, was one such extraordinary person.
She was born in Ireland as Margret Elizabeth Noble but Swami Vivekanand gave her the name NIVEDITA.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
She was so impressed by Swami Vivekanand that she renounced her happy- prosperous life and dedicated herself to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita felt very hurt by the atrocities of the British rule.
The Britishers not only made us slaves but they tried to enslave us mentally as well.
Constant efforts to belittle our culture and make us feel inferior were on.
Bhagini Nivedita ji revived the dignity and pride of Indian culture.
She brought the people together by infusing a sense of national-awakening.
She travelled to various countries and raised her voice against the mischievous propaganda against Sanatan Dharma and ideology.
Renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanya Bharati is well known for his revolutionary poem Pudhumai Penn or New woman and is renowned for his efforts for Women empowerment.
It is said that Bhagini Nivedita was the inspiration.
Bhagini Nivedita ji also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
She helped publication of Basu’s research and publicity through her articles and conferences.
This is India’s unique beauty that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are a powerful testimony to this.
In 1899, plague broke out in Calcutta and hundreds of people lost their lives in no time.
Sister Nivedita, without caring for her health, started cleaning drains and roads.
She was a woman who could live a luxurious life but she dedicatedly worked for the poor.
Getting inspiration from her sacrifice, people came forward and joined her.
Through her work, she spread the message of the importance of cleanliness and service to mankind.
And, it is inscribed on her grave – “Here reposes Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India”.
Undoubtedly, she did so.
Children are the emerging heroes in the creation of new India.
Your concern is correct that the diseases which surfaced in old age, or emerged around the last lap of life – have started to appear in children nowadays.
Today these diseases are known as ‘lifestyle disorders.’
One of the main reasons for being afflicted with such diseases at a young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in our eating habits.
Society and the family need to pay attention towards this crisis.
If you’ll start paying attention to it, you will see that there is no need to do anything extraordinary.
You just need to make small regular changes in order to transform your habits, making them a part of your way of life.
I would like the family to consciously try to inculcate in children the habit of playing in open grounds.
If possible, we can make the elder family members accompany these children to the playground and play with them.
The children can be made to take the stairs instead of taking the lift.
After dinner, the entire family can go for a walk with the children.
The practice of Yoga 30 minutes before school can impart much benefit.
No special tools or fields are needed.
There are several studies being conducted on how Yoga is effective in curbing diabetes.
These studies are being carried out in AIIMS too and the results that have emerged so far are very encouraging.
Do not look at Ayurveda and Yoga as a means of medical treatment only; instead of this we should make them a part of our life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, we have been getting glad tidings from the field of sports.
In different games, our athletes have made the country proud.
In hockey, India has won the Asia Cup hockey title through its dazzling performance.
Our players performed magnificently and on the basis of their sterling efforts, India has become the Asia Cup champion after an interval of ten years.
India had earlier won the Asia Cup in Hockey in the years 2003 and 2007.
I extend felicitations on behalf of the entire nation to the entire team and support staff.
After hockey, good news for India also came in badminton.
Badminton star Kidambi Srikanth has filled every Indian’s heart with pride by clinching the Denmark Open title with his excellent performance.
After Indonesia Open and Australia Open, this win has completed the triad of the super series premiere title.
I congratulate our young friend, Kidambi Srikanth for this feat and enhancing the prestige of India.
Friends, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month.
Teams from all over the world came to India and all of them exhibited their skills on the football field.
This world cup was a super event where the whole world was watching you.
Such a big spectacle, I was astounded to see the energy, enthusiasm, and zeal of all the young players.
The world cup was successfully organized and all the teams performed their best.
Regardless of the fact that India could not win the title, the young players of India won the hearts of everyone.
The whole world including India enjoyed this mega festival of sports and this whole tournament was both full of interest and entertainment for football lovers.
The signs that the future of football is very bright have started to appear.
I extend my congratulations and good wishes to all the players, their colleagues, and all the sports lovers once again.
My dear countrymen, a multitude of people write to me about ‘Swachch Bharat’, I feel that if I have to do justice to their feelings then I will have to do the program ‘Mann Ki Baat’ every day and every day ‘Mann Ki Baat’ will be dedicated solely to the subject of cleanliness.
Some listeners send photo graphs of the efforts undertaken by children whereas others mention the role of youth in these efforts.
Sometimes there is a story of an innovation to bring about cleanliness or winds of change that get ushered due to an official’s zeal.
A few days ago I received a very detailed report highlighting the story of transformation of Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
Just on seeing these pictures, your disappointment will transform into hope.
This mammoth effort of bringing about cleanliness is a wonderful example of fostering aesthetics, co-operation and continuum.
Forts are symbols of our heritage.
And it is the duty of all countrymen to keep our historical heritage safe and clean.
I congratulate Ecological Protection Organization, their entire team and the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, we’ll celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the 4th of November.
Guru Nanak Dev ji is not only the first guru of Sikhs; he’s guru to the entire world.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
Guru Nanak Dev ji undertook a 28 thousand kilometre journey on foot and throughout the journey spread the message of true humanity.
He entered into a dialogue with people and showed them the path of truth, sacrifice & dedication.
He advocated the message of equality in society, not through mere words but through concrete endeavour.
He ran a LANGAR which sowed the seeds of the spirit of service amongst fellow beings.
Partaking of LANGAR together created a feeling of unity & oneness in people.
In order to convey his ideals, Guru Nanak Dev ji composed the Gurbani.
Come 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th PRAKASH VARSH of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Come, let us try & advance on the path of his ideals & teachings.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s speciality was that he not only put forth revolutionary ideas; he was immensely capable of devising practical solutions to the most complicated problems in the way.
Translating a thought into reality was his forte’.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took on the reins of weaving a unified India.
He ensured that millions of Indians were brought under the ambit of one nation & one constitution.
He had said “No division of caste or creed should be able to stop us, all are the sons & daughters of India, all of us should love our country and we should carve out our destiny on the foundation of mutual love & harmony.
These lofty ideals of Sardar Sahab are relevant to and inspiring for our vision for a New India, even today.
And that is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
His contribution in giving a unified texture to the nation is without parallel.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Sahab, Run for Unity will be organized throughout the country, which will see the participation of children, youth, women, in fact people of all age groups.
I urge you to participate in Run for Unity, the festival of mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, you must’ve returned to your respective routines after the Diwali vacation, with a new resolve, with a new determination.
May all your dreams come true, my best wishes to you.
Many many Thanks.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
It will perhaps be difficult for us to forget the year’s summer..
But, we are now awaiting the rains.
As I am talking to you today , the holy month of Ramzan has already commenced .
I convey my hearty greetings to all fellow Indians and everyone across the world, especially the Muslim brethren at the advent of this auspicious month of Ramazan.
Prayer, spirituality and charity are accorded the highest priority during Ramzan.
In the ultimate , any religion, faith, ideology or tradition- give us the message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely be helpful in further strengthening these values of peace, unity and goodwill.
I, once again convey my best wishes to all.
They are making efforts to know about nature and are learning the art of living and trying to understand the world.
I had almost left the habit of reading.
Therefore I decided to pick up the habit during vacations.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle , it was then I realized that how much struggle was involved in getting India freed, how much sacrifices were given and how so many freedom fighters spent years in prison.
I am particularly inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved so much at such a young age.
Therefore I request you that you tell something to the younger generation today on this topic.”
I am delighted that younger generation is taking interest in knowing about our history, about our freedom fighters and about those who made sacrifices for the country.
Many years ago, I visited Andaman & Nicobar Islands.
I went to see the Cellular Jail there.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkarji.
Veer Savarkarji had written a book “Majhi Jannmathep” while in incarceration .
He used to write poems on the walls of his prison cell.
He was confined to a very small cell.
These seekers freedom must have gone through immense torture.
I was inspired to visit the Cellular Jail only after reading Savarkarji’s book “Maazi Janmthep”.
A light and sound show is also shown there which is very inspiring.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkarjee.
My dear countrymen, 5th of June is the first Monday of the month.
This year the United Nations have chosen the theme ‘Connecting People to Nature’.
In other words, we may say “back to basics”.
In my view, it means getting connected with one’s own self.
Connecting with nature means nurturing a better planet.
And, who can explain this in a better way than Mahatma Gandhi?
You might have also observed that whenever we feel tired and exhausted, splashing a glass of water on our face has a wonderful rejuvenating effect.
If you return after a tiring day’s work, just open the windows and doors of the room and take a deep breath of fresh air – this will fill you with fresh energy.
Our body is made up of five basic elements and whenever we come in contact with these elements we get fresh energy.
Now on, kindly make it a point to notice that whenever you come in contact with a natural condition , a new spirit emerges from within you.
So, the global campaign of connecting with nature on 5th June should become our individual campaign as well.
And we are reaping the benefits of the efforts made by our ancestors to save the environment.
And if we shall protect the environment, our future generations will reap the benefits.
Vedas, describe the Earth and the Environment as the basic sources of energy.
In India, it has been said – “Earth is the mother and I am her son”.
According to Vedas, the purity within us is because of the Earth.
The Earth is our mother and we all are her children.
If we recall Lord Buddha, a fact comes to light that his birth, his enlightenment and his Mahaparinirvana, all three happened under a tree.
But we need to present this in modern language and integrate with modern arguments.
These days , I keep receiving news from our states.
The whole world observes this as World Yoga Day.
In a very short time, 21st June has got worldwide recognition as World Yoga day and is connecting people.
At a time when separatist forces are raising their ugly heads this has been India’s great contribution to the world..
We have successfully connected the whole world through Yoga.
Like Yoga connects body, mind, heart and soul: similarly it is connecting the world now.
Because of life style, because of the mad race to achieve success and because of increasing responsibilities, leading a stress- free life has become very difficult.
It is seen, this situation is coming up even at a comparatively younger age.
At a time when People are gobbling up medicines indiscriminately and passing their days, Yoga plays a very vital role in helping people to lead a stress-free life.
Yoga is a guarantee of wellness and fitness both.
Just two days back, I have written letters to all governments and all leaders of the world about the Yoga Day.
We shall gradually advance in that direction.
I have received one suggestion and I compliment the gentleman who has made this creative suggestion.
It is a very interesting suggestion.
He has said since this is the Third International Yoga Day I should make an appeal that on this third international Yoga Day, three generations of the family should do yoga together.
Grand parents, parents and children should together perform Yoga and also upload their photos.
It will be such pleasant blend of Yesterday, today and tomorrow that it will lend a new dimension to Yoga.
Start practicing from today itself.
You too kindly spread the message of Yoga and connect people with it.
I invite you all to get connected to it.
Ever since you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the Pradhan Sewak- the Chief Servant of the people and when for the first time when I got a chance to address from the ramparts of Red Fort on 15th August, I had talked of cleanliness.
From then onwards, I get a chance to stay in different parts of the country.
And, I have seen that people closely follow as to what Modi does, where does Modi go, what all has Modi done.
This phone call will also attract your attention.
“Pranam Modi ji, I’m Naina from Mumbai.
Modi ji I watch whether on TV or Social Media, wherever you go, one can see people in that city pay special attention to cleanliness.
Mumbai or Surat, your clarion call has led people to adopt cleanliness as a mission.
Not only the elders but children also have become aware about cleanliness.
Many a time we see them telling elders not to litter on the roads.
The cleanliness drive that you had begun from the Ghats or Banks of the Ganges in Kashi has now taken the shape of a movement inspired by you.”
You are right, that wherever I go, the government machinery does the cleaning but nowadays cleanliness also turns into a social event.
Five, seven or ten days before my visit a large number of cleanliness drives are held.
A big cleanliness drive was conducted there.
I also did not see a connect is in this.
But, after receiving this phone call, I also started thinking that the point made there was pertinent.
You can very well imagine how much pleasure I derive by knowing this fact and also by noticing that the country is also closely monitoring the programme.
Besides usual arrangements to welcome the Prime Minister, cleanliness will also be high on the agenda.
This is very pleasing and inspiring for any cleanliness loving person.
I congratulate everyone connected with this Cleanliness programme providing strength to it.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
This is in a way a humorous suggestion.
I do not know whether I would be able to do it or not.
The idea is very good but I will have to think.
But, one thing is right that this movement should be encouraged and it would definitely be better if cleaning tonnes of waste are cleaned and and given as presents in place of other gifts.
How many people shall we be able to save from ill health.
This will be a big service to humanity.
One thing I would certainly like to say is that we should always consider these waste as resources and wealth.
Do not see it as just garbage.
Once we start looking at garbage and waste as a wealth, we shall also find newer, techniques of waste management.
Young persons connected with Start-ups will also come forward with newer schemes and also come forward with new equipments.
The waste from our kitchens, be it vegetable peels, leftover food, egg shells or leaves are all part of liquid waste and are to be placed in green litter bins.
This waste can be utilized in fields, and if you will remember that fields are green then you will remember what to place in the green litter bins.
The second type of waste is like old newspapers, cardboard, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, leather, polythene, broken boxes, rubber, metals and other kind of waste are all dry waste or litter which can be recycled by machines but cannot be directly used and has to be placed in the blue waste bin.
I must admit with pride that if a single individual decides it in his heart then a huge Public campaign can be launched .
Cleanliness is also one such drive.
This campaign was owned by Versova Residence volunteer or VRV.
For this outstanding work, United Nations Environment Programme or UNEP awarded ‘Champion of the Earth’ Award to Sh.
Afroz Shah, and thus he has become the first Indian to achieve this distinction.
I felicitate the mothers and sisters of Riyasi from the bottom of my heart.
I also congratulate the administrators there for making an excellent beginning by turning one block in the state of Jammu and Kashmir open defecation free.
My dear countrymen, an audit and assessment of the performance of the present government in the last three years is happening all over on newspapers, social media or TV for the last 15 days..
Three years ago you vested the responsibility of ‘Pradhan Sewak’- the Chief Servant of the People upon me.
There have been many surveys and several opinion polls.
I see this entire process as a very healthy sign.
The works done during these years were tested on every touch stone .
It was analyzed by every segment of society.
And this is a great process in democracy.
Whether something is good, little less effective or bad, whatever it is, one has to learn from it and move ahead in life putting the learning from it into practice.
My dear countrymen, I too am an ordinary citizen like you and like any ordinary citizen I too am influenced by good or bad things.
Now I feel as if I’m conversing with my family while sitting at home.
And there are many families who have written to me these very feelings.
And as I said, as an ordinary citizen, I too get affected emotionally.
Two days ago there was a launch of an analytical book on ‘Mann Ki Baat’ at Rashtrapati Bhavan, it was attended by the Hon’ble President, Hon’ble Vice President , Madam Speaker of the Lok sabha and as an ordinary citizen and as an individual this was very inspirational event for me.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahab.
My many felicitations and best wishes to you.

“I salute the services of our civilian and defence officials and organisations in helping evacuate our citizens from Yemen.
Continue your efforts!
Seamless co-operation between organisations – Ministry of External Affairs, Navy, Air Force, Air India, Shipping, Railways and State Govts greatly helped in rescue work.
Colleagues Smt Sushma Swaraj and General VK Singh (who has been on the ground for days), have co-ordinated evacuation efforts in an exemplary manner.
I am also glad that India has rescued several non-Indian citizens from Yemen.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has approved implementation of Shahpurkandi Dam Project, Punjab on river Ravi.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today called upon the NCC cadets to dedicate their lives to the nation and the welfare of its people.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today released the Dictionary of Martyrs of India’s Freedom Struggle, at an event in Lok Kalyan Marg, New Delhi.
Speaking on the occasion, he said this five-volume dictionary contains an account of the martyrs from India’s First War of Independence in 1857, to India’s Independence in 1947.
He said that this includes the martyrs of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the non-cooperation movement, the Quit India Movement, and those soldiers of the Azad Hind Fauj, who attained martyrdom, among many others.
He said that this was the first attempt at compiling the names of martyrs on this scale.
He appreciated all those involved with the compilation, and the effort behind it.
The Prime Minister asserted that a nation that does not honour and remember those who created, or are an important part, of its history, often does not have a secure future.
In that sense, he added that this effort, is not just a way to cherish the past, but is also a way to secure the future.
He said that youth should especially be made aware of this effort.
The Prime Minister said that India, so far, did not have a war memorial since independence.
He said that recently, he dedicated the National War Memorial, or Rashtriya Samar Smaarak, to the nation.
Similarly, he said the National Police Memorial has also been built.
He also mentioned the world’s tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, in honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
He said that in memory of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Azad Hind Fauj, the Kranti Mandir has been established at Red Fort.
He said museums are also being built to commemorate the brave deeds of the Adivasi heroes who were part of our freedom struggle.
The Union Minister of State for Culture (I/C) Dr. Mahesh Sharma was present on the occasion.
In this dictionary a martyr has been defined as a person who died or who was killed in action or in detention, or was awarded capital punishment while participating in the national movement for emancipation of India.
It includes ex-INA or ex-military personnel who died fighting the British.
It includes the martyrs of 1857 Uprising, Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (1919), Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22), Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-34), Quit India Movement (1942-44), Revolutionary Movements (1915-34), Kissan Movements, Tribal Movements, Agitation for Responsible Government in the Princely States (Prajamandal), Indian National Army (INA, 1943-45), Royal Indian Navy Upsurge (RIN, 1946), etc.

Today is also a special day in the history of India`s freedom struggle.
Mauritius has stood as a bright beacon of democracy.
This is a nation of a little over a million people of huge diversity living in great harmony.
It is a nation moving firmly on the path of prosperity.
They have created goodwill and warmth rarely seen in international relations.
They have built an unbreakable chain of trust between us.
Today we are equally proud to have a relationship that speaks to the needs of our times.
We speak in one voice in the cause of the developing world and the future of our planet.
What we now have, though, in both nations is a stable platform to speed up economic development.
Over the last nine months, we in India have moved with a clear vision of inclusive development.
We have acted with speed, resolve, innovation and boldness to increase economic growth; reform our economy and transform the lives of our people; and create opportunities for the most excluded youth, the remotest farmer and the farthest village.
I am confident that under Prime Minister Jugnauth, development in Mauritius will become more impressive.
And, I can assure you that as always we will be with you – in support of your efforts and in joy for your success.
This will further strengthen the position of Mauritius as a regional economic hub.
We are seeking to develop our marine economy and discover new possibilities.
For India and Mauritius, our destinies are linked by the currents of the Indian Ocean.
We believe that all nations in our region should come together to shoulder our shared responsibility.
Thank you very much.
Senior CEOs from the Republic of Korea today called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.
They are currently in New Delhi for the Indo-Korea Business Summit.
The CEOs discussed possibilities of enhancing business cooperation between the two countries.
Teachers have a central role in realising our dream of a ‘New India’ that is driven by cutting edge research and innovation.
On top of it, due to continuous drought over the past couple of years, the usual water storage facilities have been adversely affected.
I was recently told that in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the Hivrebazaar Gram Panchayat and its villagers have addressed the problem of water shortage by treating it as a major and delicate issue.
They have decided to give up cultivation of those crops that require a lot of water, like sugarcane and banana.
It sounds very simple, but in reality it is not so.
What a big collective decision this must have been?
If one tells the owners of factories that consume a lot of water about the consequences of this consumption and requests them to shut down their units, one can well imagine what the response would be.
I might be talking of a small place like Hivrebazaar, but there must be many other such villages.
I extend my hearty felicitations to such villagers for their fine work.
I was told that in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Gorva Gram Panchayat took up the drive to create farm ponds.
They have already created 27 farm ponds.
Due to this there has been an increase in the ground water level.
Not only has water been saved, the quality of water has also vastly improved with the water level increasing.
When the government used railways to transport water to Latur, it became news for the world.
There is no doubt that the swift manner in which Indian Railways has acted is praiseworthy.
But villagers who have taken various initiatives to save water also deserve equal amount of praise.
Indeed, I would say they deserve greater praise.
It is human nature that no matter how many perils people face, when they hear a good news from any corner, they feel as if the entire crisis is over.
Thus ever since the day it became public knowledge that rainfall this year is expected to be between 106% and 110% it seems as if tidings of peace and happiness have come.
There is still some time for the monsoon to arrive, but the news of good rains has already brought joy.
Farmers need fertile soil in their fields to grow crops.
This time why can’t we take the soil from the bottom of ponds for our fields?
If we were to do this, the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase.
Can we fill empty cement and fertiliser bags with pebbles and sand and use them to stop water from flowing out through breaches?
I have always said that people who visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, can also see there the underground tanks constructed about 200 years ago, that were built to save rain water.
Water collected in these tanks remained pure.
Mr. Kumar Krishna has asked on MyGov whether “the cleaning of Ganga will be possible while we our alive”.
Many governments came, plans were made to clean Ganga, and a lot of expenditure was incurred without showing results.
For this reason there must be crores of Indians like Kumar Krishna who have the same question in their hearts.
For those who are religiously inclined, Ganga is the path to salvation for them.
I too accept this importance of Ganga.
But more than that, Ganga is the giver of life.
We get our daily bread from Ganga, we get our earnings from Ganga, and we get a new source of energy from Ganga to live our lives.
The flow of Ganga adds momentum to the economic pace of the country.
Bhagirath did bring down the river Ganga for us, but to save it, we need crores of Bhagiraths.
The project to clean Ganga cannot be successful without mass participation by the people.
So we all will have to become agents of change to achieve cleanliness.
We are seeking the full cooperation of all the states through which Ganga flows.
We are also trying to get voluntary organisations to join us in this effort.
We have taken several steps for surface cleaning and to stop industrial pollution.
Every day, effluents and garbage in a large quantity flow into Ganga through drains.
At Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna – trash skimmers have been deployed which clean the river while floating on it.
All local bodies have been given this facility and they have been urged to carry on with this work continuously and clean all the garbage from the river.
I have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day.
So it would be correct to say that pollutants in such a large quantity are being stopped from getting into the river.
In the coming days, we have plans to deploy such trash skimmers at other places also and the benefits of it will be felt by the people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna.
I feel it will yield good results.
I am very happy that in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, where there was discharge from distilleries, there has been a change for the better.
Officers have told me that they have been successful in securing zero liquid discharge.
The discharge from the pulp and paper industry or the liquor industry is almost coming to an end.
All these things are a sign that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
I have seen that not just on the banks of Ganga, even in far off South if one meets a person, he is sure to ask, “ Sir, will Ganga be cleaned?”
This faith and hope of the common people is going to ensure success in the cleaning of Ganga.
My dear fellow citizens, today is the 24th of April.
This is observed as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
On this day, the Panchayati Raj system was implemented in our country.
Panchayati Raj system has gradually spread to the entire country and is functioning successfully as an important unit of our democratic system of governance.
We celebrated 14th April as the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedekar and today we celebrate 24th April as Panchayati Raj Day.
At 3 in the afternoon I shall be talking to all panchayats of the country.
I congratulate all the State Governments and the village heads.
They have gone about these programmes in a very novel way for the welfare of villages, for the development of villages and for the strengthening of democracy.
The awareness that has come about in villages guarantees a new progress for India.
I am Sharmila Dharpure speaking from Mumbai.
I have a question for you about the school and college education.
For the last so many years, a strong need for reforms has been felt in the education sector.
Either the required amount of schools and colleges are not there or else the quality in education is lacking.
It has been often found that the children complete their schooling but they still don’t have knowledge about the most basic things and so they lag behind in this competitive world.
What are your views?
How do you wish to bring about reforms?”
Today in every home, the first thing that the parents dream of is to give their children good education.
A house, a car – all that comes later.
And for a country like India, this common sentiment of the people is a very big force.
So I would appeal to all guardians and parents to give not just enough time and attention to their children but also to everything that’s happenings in their school.
And if something strikes your attention, please go to the school and discuss it with the teachers yourself.
Vigilance can be of help to reduce many shortcomings in the education system.
People’s participation will go a long way in achieving this.
Every Government in our country has laid stress on education and every Government has made efforts for it in its own way.
It is true that for a long time our focus has been on setting up educational institutions, expanding the system of education, building schools, building colleges, recruiting teachers, ensuring maximum attendance of children.
So priority has been given in a way to the spread of education.
This was necessary.
But today more than expanding education what is necessary is to improve the quality of education.
We have already done a lot towards expanding education.
Now we will have to focus on quality education.
We will have to shift our priority from literacy campaign to good education.
You must have seen the Budget of the present government.
An effort is being made to provide quality education.
But it is true we still have a long way to go.
If we, 125 crore Indians, resolve, we can cover that distance.
Sharmila ji has rightly said that we do need to bring reforms for quality education.
You must have noticed in the Budget that we have decided to do something unconventional.
We have done this with the intention of giving them a free hand.
Indian universities can also compete with world class universities, and they should.
Along with importance to education, there is importance to skill.
Likewise, technology plays a very big role in education.
Long distance education and technology will make the task of education simpler.
I believe that the results of this move are going to be seen in the near future.
For the youth in today’s age, along with studies, sports are also of great importance.
They should have a feeling of team spirit and the qualities of a good leader for their overall holistic development.
You people have been sending me so many suggestions that one day I felt that first of all I must talk to these people.
It was under pressure from you people, following your suggestions, that I recently called for a meeting with the chiefs of NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides, Red Cross and the Nehru Yuva Kendra.
I asked them if they have ever had a meeting before, and they said that since Independence, this was the first time that they were attending a meeting like this.
So first I would like to felicitate my young friends who put pressure on me, the result of which was that I held this meeting.
I felt glad that I met them.
I felt the need for greater coordination.
They are doing a lot in their own way but if work is done collectively, in an organized manner, then these various organizations of ours can bring about huge results.
They are spread so wide, reaching out to so many families.
This time I put some issues before them.
I told them that for this season why don’t all these organizations and our youth make an effort for water conservation.
We could collectively try and stop open defecation in so many blocks and so many districts.
Now even you will wish to join one of them.
My dear fellow citizens, I now wish to talk about something that will compel us all to think.
I view it also as something that is going to shake us all.
On the other hand, economists have put constant pressure to reduce the subsidy on gas cylinders.
For this reason, many committees would sit which would receive many proposals and suggestions on the issue of lessening the gas subsidy.
Today, my dear fellow citizens, I have utmost pleasure in placing before you all my own account on this.
I have chosen the third way out and that is the path of placing trust and confidence in the people and the masses.
At times we political leaders should trust our people more than we trust ourselves.
I had said it just like that, but today I can say with confidence that I am indeed very proud of you all.
One crore families have voluntarily given up their subsidy on gas cylinders.
These one crore are not wealthy families.
But it has been estimated that more than 80% of these one crore families chose to go to the distributor, stand in a queue and give in writing that they wish to surrender their subsidy.
My dear fellow citizens, this is not a small matter.
At some point of time they will also have to think of this novel experience that has defied conventional thinking.
One crore families giving up their subsidy on gas cylinders and in return one crore poor families getting gas cylinders with the money that is saved from the one crore families that have given up their subsidy.
I have always felt this way, like when I felt why Class 3 and Class 4 employees should be made to go through interviews.
We should trust the person who has given the exams and submitted the marks.
Sometimes I feel that we should publicly announce that today on this route of the railways there will be no ticket checker.
Let’s see what happens when we place faith in the people of India.
We can undertake several such experiments.
This atmosphere has not been created by any political leader but by one crore families of India.
Each newspaper and news channel has bad news for its every ‘breaking news’.
Is there not anything good happening around in this country populated by 125 crore people?
Please change this situation.”
You may remember that the former President of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, used to always say, “Please print only positive news on the front page of the newspaper”.
These days I have noticed that some T.V. channels have begun setting aside some time for positive news.
So it is right to say that there is an atmosphere all around of positive news.
And everybody feels that the people should get the right news and good news.
It is true that even if the most highly placed men and women relate the best possible things in the best possible words and in the best possible manner, good news has a better impact than that.
Good news becomes the greatest reason and inspiration to do something good.
It is true that the more we give prominence to good things, the less space there will be for bad things.
If we light a lamp, the darkness is sure to be dispelled.
You can contribute to the site.
We all should strive together to do something positive, talk about something positive, to spread something positive.
There is one great speciality of our country — the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela can become the centre of tourist attraction as well.
Very few know that since a long time, crores and crores of people have gathered on the river-banks for this festival.
The peaceful atmosphere at the Kumbh Mela gives moments of tranquillity to the soul.
These festivals, from the point of view of organization, event management and people’s participation, set new and high standards.
I have been noticing for the last two days that many people have uploaded pictures of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela.
I would like the Tourism Department of the Government of India and the State Government to hold a photo competition on this occasion.
People should be encouraged to take the finest photographs and upload them.
This can surely be done.
We can turn it into an occasion of imbibing good values.
It can become a reason to carry good resolutions and good habits to all the villages.
Ambassador Ms. Nikki Haley, United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations called on Prime Minister Modi, today.
Ambassador Haley conveyed greetings from President Trump.
Ambassador Haley noted the deepening relations between India and the US particularly in strategic and defence sectors.
Both the dignitaries discussed ways to enhance India- US cooperation including on counter-terrorism and in multilateral fora.
They expressed confidence that strong India-US partnership will continue to be an important factor for global peace and prosperity.
Let me begin by expressing my deepest condolences on the loss of lives in the terrorist attack on a civilian Russian aircraft and in the unfortunate downing of the military jet in Syria.
In this moment of grief and challenge, we stand in solidarity with the people of Russia.
Mr. President, thank you for generous and warm hospitality.
Mr. President, I have always had great respect and appreciation for our strategic partnership.
It has been a source of strength and success for India in defence, development and diplomacy.
And, there is genuine goodwill and mutual respect between our people.
As I look to the future, I see Russia as a significant partner in India’s economic transformation and in shaping a balanced, stable, inclusive and a multi-polar world.
We have had excellent conversations over the past two days and very productive outcomes.
It has deepened my conviction that this relationship truly meets the test of a special and privileged strategic partnership.
We have laid the foundation of the future character of this strategic partnership.
The Inter-Governmental Agreement on manufacture of Kamov 226 helicopter in India is the first project for a major defence platform under the Make in India mission.
It is rightly with our most important defence partner.
We have made progress on a number of other defence proposals.
These would boost defence manufacturing in India and India’s defence readiness with next generation equipment.
The pace of our cooperation in nuclear energy is increasing.
We are making progress on our plans for twelve Russian nuclear reactors at two sites.
The agreement today will increase Indian manufacturing content in these reactors.
It supports my mission of Make in India.
I thank President Putin for his support.
With one of the world’s largest reserves of hydrocarbons, Russia can be a critical source of energy security for India, especially because of our strategic partnership.
With President Putin’s support, we are enlarging Indian investments in Russian hydrocarbon sector.
President Putin and I are moving creatively in expanding our economic relations.
Following our last Summit, India has created a special notified zone to facilitate direct trade between the world’s largest uncut diamond exporter, Russia, and India, which processes 90% of the world’s uncut diamond.
Second, we are working on logistics.
Our Green Corridor project has taken off.
The International North South Transit Corridor through Iran will significantly reduce transportation time and cost.
Third, we are moving forward on the India-Eurasian Economic Union Free Trade Agreement.
This will also benefit us in Central Asia.
Fourth, we are encouraging our private sector to connect with each other more.
We have just had an excellent meeting of CEO Forum.
The agreements and the announcements today give me confidence that we will see huge increase in investments and trade in both directions.
President Putin and I have a high degree of convergence in our positions on global issues and a strong commitment to deepen our international cooperation.
We have strong collaboration in the United Nations.
Our membership of BRICS, East Asia Summit, G20 and now Shanghai Cooperation Organisation gives our partnership a global character.
It is particularly important in the arc from Eurasia to Asia Pacific, including in Central Asia and Afghanistan.
We are one in our belief that the world must unite and take concerted action on combating terrorism, without distinction and discrimination between terrorist groups and target countries.
We agree that an early political settlement through dialogue in West Asia is essential for restoring stability and containing extremism in the region.
Indeed, all nations must come together, with sensitivity to each other, to address the challenges of our times.
I am very pleased to have deepened my association with President Putin.
Together, we have also given new direction and added more momentum and content to our strategic partnership.
Just as I have had the pleasure of visiting Russia twice this year, I look forward to welcoming President Putin in India next year for the BRICS Summit as well as the Annual Summit.
You have also seen two exhibitions here on the development of villages and the emphasis laid on the importance of cleanliness.
I am sure you will get new inputs from this and a new direction to work as a Sarpanch and it will strengthen your resolve to work.
Secondly, this is an event to highlight the power of cleanliness.
There is also a Digital exhibition and virtual museum here stablished on the life of revered Bapu.
You also visit the Gandhi Kutir.
This commitment shows Gandhiji passion for cleanliness.
Indeed every government has contributed to the realisation of Ganhiji’s dream right from the days of Gandhiji.
Here are those Sarpanch sisters who had made it possible in their villages.
If in such a short span we can go up by 20 percent then in next one and half year much more can be done and it is clearly your achievement.
But the one who gets Purpose of his life, never tires and never relents heads for his goal taking every help available in the process, have his fights and face challenges till his task is fulfilled.
Your becoming Sarpanch is not a small achievement.
Some of you may not have faced hurdles but the majority had to toil hard to reach this position in a the democratic tradition.
Strange thing for me that how a government official has turned up in a party meeting.
Asking them for their justification they elaborated SP as Sarpanch Pati (Husband of Lady Sarpanch).
His becoming Sarpanch is for a new higher chair in District Board.
One who is in Jila Parishad things of State Assembly but a Women Sarpanch gets committed towards her role.
They work whole heartedly and continuously with full capacity to achieve the tasks assigned to them.
They are not quite till the work is over.
For this they are capable of mobilising proper resources with an instinct of knowing the right person in an appropriate manner without having any ego.
Active involvement of 50 percent women power in the development journey of nation can propel the country to amazing heights.
With this grave imbalance a society can not move further.
It’s a sin and the society must stand against it.
Women Sarpanch can be more successful here.
We have patriarchal society with a mind set of bias against girls as they will go to new family, rather take care of son.
In your tender age you have noticed your mother despite being a women used to pour 02 spoons of Ghee an the plate of her son and only one in the plate of daughter.
Simply because the daughter will be married in other family.
Having son is a matter of pride.
On the other hand I have also seen that aged parents are stocked to old age homes despite having 4-4 male children.
Hence have bring change in society by standing firmly against this discriminatory approach.
Surely the change is being witnessed.
In the examinations of class 10th and 12th there are only girls getting ranked at first 10 places.
We have to find the boys there.
As long as there remains the Ganga, Kurukshetra and earth, as long as the tale of Sita lives the girl child will be remembered.
You are all Sarpanchs, do one thing when you have time.
He may be aware of the Chief Ministers or Prime Ministers name but not about your name.
Tell them that being Sarpanch you want to see that no school going child in your village school be seen as lagging behind in studies.
But this summoning will give teacher a message of your being pro-active and having a concern for quality education.
Though rest of Sarpanchs will be busy in other 50 works except this basic one.
Was there such a situation ever before?
Earlier these Sarpanchs happened to be a wealthy city dwellers just extending hospitality to guests.
While in villages there used to live one or two persons in their homes.
If in village you set a target f 25 works to be done in 5 years, you can do them easily and with success.
Call Anganwadi workers some day or visit the Anganvadi for a while and check there the sanitation and cleanliness, the status of teachers and the quality of food being served, feeding of children present there, also whether the required plays and games are being taken care off?
You should exert leadership and pay a little attention there too.
Being Sarpanch also ensure that this happens actually and the school teacher and vaccination staff is coming to village regularly.
If our Sarpanch exerts their leadership in getting these schemes implemented without any extra expense then benefits will be impressing.
Often we have thought about the causes of diseases occurring in villages .
Now a days our focus is on toilets.
But have thought about the benefits of sanitation?
According to a World Bank report the average expenditure of a poor family on treatment of diseases arising out of unhygienic environment is seven thousand rupees per annum.
Keeping our villages clean and doesn’t allowing any disease to happen in villages will definitely save those 7 thousand rupees.
This money will be spent by the poor on milk procurement.
Then there will be surely healthy children in your villages.
Rabindra Nath Tagore wrote: A village is just like a women and her image.
And in the existence of women prevails the welfare of humanity.
Compared to cities villages are more close to nature and are tuned more with the flow of life.
In them lies the natural power of healing the wounds.
Villages provide all happiness as well as food to all like women just as an easy life poem.
Sometimes we had thought of the draining of village resources .
Should the nature be saved or not?
Why Should not there be a village with ample greenery and pure air where the city dwellers get tempted to pass their quality time in a small cottage of their own and be there for a weekend in such an ideal village ?
Government is also working on Rurban Mission.
A place with rural spirit and city facilities.
Work is going on to connect every panchayat in the country through Optical Fibre Cable..
Of the 2.5 lakh panchayats, nearly 70 thousands have been connected so far.
Government is also working for modernity of villages.
Here while seeing this exhibition my Secretary informed me that the sarpanch sisters are also taking this exhibition very attentively and every one was busy there taking Selfie.
Their was answer was: we will get it downloaded.
I was taken aback, these sisters are illiterate but still saying of downloading.
Now the technology is in the life of a common person.
In our system the Government of India has opened up Common Service Centres.
Have you ever inquired about the employment provided to youth using technology in these Common Service Centres?
What kind of services are being rendered by these computers and how these services could be used for village and how you can be benefitted from these amenities?
I mean to say that we should try to bring technology and its use in our villages also.
And this will definitely bring a visible change in your villages too.
May be we are not knowing every thing but we can take those along with us who have knowledge of it.
Because it is the women power of our country who has contributed most for cleanliness.
Every type of hygiene, cleanliness of each and every facet of social life, values , virtues and kind deeds are if thriving today are just because of the contribution of Mother-Power.
My colleagues of the Council of Ministers, Shri Thawar Chand Gehlot ji,
Shri Vijay Goyal ji,
Secretary Social Justice and Empowerment, Lata Krishna Rao ji;
I am really fortunate to dedicate the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre (DAIC) to the country.
Moreover, my joy has doubled due the fact that I had laid the foundation-stone for this international centre in April 2015.
This grand International Centre is ready not only in a very short time but before its scheduled time.
I congratulate every department associated with the construction of this centre.
I sincerely hope that this Centre will prove to be a great inspiration for spreading Babasaheb’s teachings.
Friends, several great souls were born in our country from time to time, who not only became the face of social reform but also played a significant role in building the future of the country and shaping the thought process of the country.
The strength of Babasaheb is evident from the fact that over the years attempts have been made to suppress his ideas and to negate his contribution in the nation building process but no one could erase the ideas of Babasaheb from the minds of the Indians.
I won’t be wrong to say that the people today are more influenced by the ideas of Babasaheb than the family which was behind the conspiracy.
We are indebted to Babasaheb for his contribution to the nation building.
Similarly, the birthplace of Babasaheb which is Mhou of Madhya Pradesh is being developed as a pilgrimage centre.
The London residence of Babasaheb is being transformed into a memorial by the BJP government of Maharashtra after its purchase.
The ‘Panchteerth’ or the five pilgrimage centres are in a way tribute to Baba Saheb on behalf of today’s generation.
By the way, a sixth pilgrimage Centre has also been developed in the virtual world last year.
This pilgrimage Centre is empowering the country and providing impetus to it digitally.
Bharat Interface for Money i.e. the BHIM app that was launched last year was a tribute to Babasaheb’s financial vision by this government.
BHIM app has proved to be a boon for the poor, the Dalit, the backward and the exploited people.
But besides the struggles, his life is also full of inspirations.
Far from the despair he had dreamt of an India that will be free from all the evils and will be inclusive of all.
A few days after the first meeting of the Constituent Assembly, on December 17, 1946 he had said-
But I am quite convinced that given time and circumstance nothing in the world will be able to prevent this country from becoming united.
With all our castes and creeds I have not the slightest hesitation that we shall in some form be a united people.
The type of conduct suggests that we have that capability of moving towards the path of unity by moving together with all the components.”
Some people give more importance to the caste in which they have taken birth than the land on which they have taken birth.
I believe that today’s new generation is capable of eliminating these social evils.
Mainly the changes that have taken place in the past 15 to 20 years are only due to the efforts of the new generation.
The social democracy was the Mantra of freedom and equality for every Indian.
This equality is not only in terms of the rights, but also of the way of living.
But even after so many years of independence there is no equality in the lives of millions of people.
Even the basic amenities such as electricity connection, water connection, a small house, Life Insurance are far from accessible.
If you closely look at our government’s way of working and our work culture for the past 3 to 3 and a half years, you will notice that we have been trying to fulfil that dream of Babasaheb’s social democracy.
The schemes and the policies of this government focus upon strengthening the social democracy.
If we look at the Jan Dhan Yojana we will see that it has provided the right of connecting with the banking system to millions of poor people of the country.
They have been elevated to that class of people that have bank accounts and debit cards.
The government has helped to open bank accounts of more than 30 crore poor people under the scheme.
RuPay debit cards have been provided to more than 23 crore people.
How many of you get the opportunity to visit your village after every 4 or 5 months?
I request those who have not been to their villages for a long time to now visit their village and see.
Go and ask someone from your village about the Ujjwala scheme.
You will see how the Ujjwala scheme has eliminated the difference between the households which was created by gas connections in some houses and firewood in the rest of the households.
This is a major example of how the government has eliminated the social discrimination.
Now even the poor households cook their food on gas ovens.
Now the poor woman does not have to spend her life in the smoke of the firewood.
This is one difference which can be easily understood by the people who are more connected to their villages.
When you go to your village you will also feel the influence of another scheme.
Through these schemes, a premium of only 1 Rupee per month is required for accident insurance and 90 Paisa per day for Life Insurance.
You will be surprised to know that under the schemes, a sum of rupees 1800 crores approximately has been given to the poor.
Just imagine today the poor in the rural areas are living a tension-free life.
Brothers and sisters, the essence of Babasaheb’s ideology has been rooted in many forms:
Such issues have been raised by Babasaheb in his lifetime.
He always hoped that the governments in India would follow the Constitution without discriminating against different castes.
Today, in every scheme of this government you will see a glimpse of the efforts to give equal rights to all without discrimination.
Just recently the government has launched another scheme – ‘Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Har Ghar Bijli Yojana or Saubhagya scheme’.
The Saubhagya scheme is going to end this inequality that was prevailing since the past 70 years.
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is another such scheme that aims at removing the inequality.
Therefore the government aims at providing every poor of the village and the city with his own house by the year 2022.
Efforts are being made to provide equality in terms of residence so that no one is deprived of a house.
You might remember, I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort in 2014 that within one year all the government schools in the country will have a separate toilet for the daughters.
We have built more than 4 Lakh toilets in schools within a year.
The girls used to dropout of schools due to lack of toilets in the schools.
Similarly, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana was launched in July 2015.
Our target was to complete 99 irrigation projects of the country that were stuck midway for years by 2019.
So far 21 projects have been completed.
Next year more than 50 projects will be completed.
The progress of the scheme is also within the purview of the target.
We have launched the e- National Agriculture Market scheme (e-NAM) in April 2016 so that the farmers are able to get fair prices for their crops that will help them to sell their crops easily.
Under the scheme, the government has planned to connect more than 580 Mandis in the country online.
So far more than 470 agricultural markets have been added online.
Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which I mentioned earlier, was launched on 1st May last year.
The government has set a target of providing gas connections to 5 crore poor women by 2019.
In just 19 months, the government has given free gas connections to more than 3 crore 12 lakh women.
Brothers and sisters, this is our way of working.
But nothing happened for 23 years.
After coming to power this government had laid the foundation-stone of this centre and the same government has inaugurated it.
The political parties who ask for votes in the name of Babasaheb will probably not even be aware of this.
Well, nowadays they are thinking of Baba Bhole instead of Baba Saheb.
Recently we have reduced the deadline for ‘Indradhanush Mission’ by 2 years.
Under the Indradhanush Mission the government is holding vaccination campaigns in those areas which were not covered under the on-going vaccination campaigns.
Lakhs of children and pregnant women were left out of vaccination.
But under this campaign, more than 2.5 crore children and more than 70 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated.
The ‘Intensified Mission Indradhanush’ has been launched along with ‘Mission Indradhanush’ in order to achieve this goal.
Within 3 years of persistent efforts more than 80% of the villages are now connected to roads.
Now the government is working at a very fast pace to connect hundred per cent villages to road network.
The government’s emphasize is on encouraging Dalit and backward brothers and sisters living in far-flung areas of the country for self-employment.
So, when we started the Stand-up India programme, we decided that every Bank branch should provide loans to at least one Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe through this scheme.
Come; let us take a pledge to fulfil Babasaheb’s dreams.
May Baba Saheb give us the strength to fulfil these resolutions by the year 2022.
I would like to end my speech with this desire.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin of Russia exchanged warm greetings for the Year 2019 in a telephonic conversation today.
The two leaders appreciated the major milestones achieved in the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between the two countries in the past year.
President Putin reiterated the invitation to the annual Eastern Economic Forum in September 2019.
Bilateral cooperation in the key areas including defence and counter-terrorism was also discussed.
Both leaders agreed that India-Russia cooperation plays an important role in the global multilateral order.
Speaking on the occasion, he said that Swami Dayananda, continues to inspire even today.
He said that the Arya Samaj, which was founded in the backdrop of the 1857 uprising for Independence, fought against superstition, and has been a force for reform.
The Prime Minister said that the Naya Sankalp – new resolve – should be to raise India’s stature globally.
This, he said, would be true homage to Swami Dayananda.
He said that with DAV’s huge strength of students and alumni, if they resolve to work on certain issues, they can together achieve significant results in a short span of time.
He said the attempt should always be to create a modern and scientific India of the 21st century.
The Prime Minister noted that the DAV College Management Committee had offered to support his Clean Ganga initiative.
Welcoming this, the Prime Minister said that this was an initiative that could only succeed through people’s involvement.
Last year, in March, I was in Jaffna.
The warmth and affection that I received from the people of Jaffna is still fresh in my mind.
Today is another landmark day.
When, once again, we celebrate our partnership with the people of Sri Lanka and with residents of Jaffna.
Today, along with President Sirisena, we dedicate the renovated Durraiappah Stadium to the people of Sri Lanka.
And, we are not alone.
The modern tools of communication have enabled 1.25 billion people of India and the friendly people of Sri Lanka to join us in this celebration.
After a wait of nearly 20 years, your applause and cheer will once again rekindle the soul of Durraiappah Stadium.
Even while we are sitting thousands of kilometres away in Delhi, we can feel the pulse of vibrancy and atmosphere of change in Jaffna.
The Durraiappah Stadium is not just brick and mortar.
It is a symbol of optimism and economic development.
An arena for a prosperous and healthy future for Jaffna’s youth.
It demonstrates your determination to shed the legacy of violence and pursue the path of economic progress.
Its foundations are supported by your courage and great sacrifices.
Its successful completion is a signal that you have left the past behind and are looking to the promise of a prosperous future.
Our relations are not limited to the confines of our two governments.
They reside in the rich contacts of our history, culture, language, art, and geography.
India strongly believes that its economic growth must drive and bring benefit to its neighbours.
Durraiappah Stadium embodies the spirit of our cooperation.
Indeed, India’s support for Sri Lanka’s development is a promise of our friendship.
This is what makes our enduring ties relevant to our present, as also to our future.
India’s desire is to see an economically prosperous Sri Lanka.
A Sri Lanka where: -unity and integrity; -peace, harmony and security; and -equal opportunity and dignity.
prevails throughout the country among all its people.
Excellency Sirisena and Friends,
In about seventy-two hours from now, the world would be celebrating the second anniversary of the International day of Yoga on 21 June.
Sri Lanka was among the first supporters of the UN resolution on this subject in 2014.
And, today, we have celebrated the start of the International day of Yoga with a curtain raiser from Jaffna, from this Durraiappah Stadium.
The ‘Surya Namaskar’, performed just a short while ago, has sent the message of holistic healthcare, harmonious and sustainable living with nature to the world.
We could not have asked for a more fitting start and tribute to the International Day of Yoga.
Durraiappah Stadium will stand as yet another symbol of our lasting friendship.
India will walk side by side with Sri Lanka as it charts its own path to progress and prosperity for all of its citizens.
I once again convey greetings to the people of Sri Lanka from 1.25 billion people of India.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Indian community in Jakarta.
He spoke of the special ties between India and Indonesia, and recalled the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi earlier this year, where leaders from 10 ASEAN nations, including Indonesia, were present.
He noted that it is no coincidence that in 1950, the President of Indonesia had been the Chief Guest at the Republic Day Parade in New Delhi.
The Prime Minister said that in the last four years, India has witnessed unparalleled transformation.
In this context, he spoke of FDI, openness of the Indian economy, ease of doing business, and competitiveness of the Indian economy.
He said both countries are proud of their democratic ethos and diversity.
He gave examples such as the Bali-Jatra, and similarities in cuisine and language to highlight the close cultural links between the two countries.
Talking about developments in India, he said that the Union Government is creating systems that are development-friendly and corruption-free.
He said that going ahead from “Ease of Doing Business,” the focus is now on “Ease of Living.”
Our processes are transparent and sensitive, he added.
He gave an account of the dramatic developments that have taken place in a number of areas of infrastructure development.
He spoke of India’s vibrant start-up ecosystem, and the International Solar Alliance.
Both India and Indonesia have a sensitive outlook when it comes to helping those in need, the Prime Minister asserted.
He said that India does not see the colour of anyone’s passport, and helps all fellow humans who require any assistance.
He said India and Indonesia do not just rhyme in their names, but share a common rhythm in their culture, traditions, and democratic values.
My colleague Shri J. P. Nadda, Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India, Shri.
Kesetebirhan Admasu, Minister of Health, Govt. of Ethiopia, Hon’ble Ministers from participating countries, representatives of Development Partners, friends from the civil society, the private sector, media, academia, national and international speakers and esteemed delegates.
On behalf of my Government and all the co-hosts for this international summit, I warmly welcome you to the Global Call to Action Summit 2015.
This is a landmark occasion, as for the first time, the Global Call to Action Summit is being held outside USA.
My Government is honoured to host this Summit.
All those delegates who have travelled a long distance to attend this Summit – I heartily welcome you to India and to New Delhi.
I am delighted to be with you this morning.
It will showcase the power of new partnerships, innovations and systems to bring about improvements in life-saving interventions.
I firmly believe that this Summit will provide a highly effective platform to address common challenges that will help us achieve the desired goals.
How we shape the world in the next 15 years will make the difference between prosperous, optimistic Nations, and insecurity and unrest.
I am glad to see 24 Nations present here to join together in their commitment to end preventable maternal and child death.
This is a “Call to Action” to all of us to seize this opportunity and think big.
The 24 priority countries participating in the Summit contribute nearly 70% of the preventable maternal and child deaths.
For India, with its birth cohort of 26 million, the challenges are formidable but the commitment to succeed is also as strong.
This forms the key peg for this Summit.
Keeping aside the work that still needs to be done, there have been significant achievements on the global front in the area of maternal and child health.
What this translates into is this: India is likely to reach close to achieving the MDG target if the current trend of annual decline is sustained.
In addition to this remarkable achievement, another truly historic accomplishment has been the victory over Polio.
India was declared as “Polio-Free” on 27 March 2014.
I am also happy to share with you today another major milestone achieved by India.
India has eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus.
This gives us the confidence to achieve other targets well before the target date.
It focusses on vaccinating the left-outs.
It also targets to accelerate the current increase in annual rate of immunization from existing 1% to more than 5% per year.
The first phase has been successfully implemented.
We want to ensure that no child in India dies of a vaccine-preventable disease.
India has always partnered with the global efforts on issues of child and maternal health.
India launched the India Newborn Action Plan (INAP) in September 2014, targeting reduction in Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) and still births to single digit by 2030.
India also responded by acting on the first “Call to Action” through its commitment and launch of RMNCH+A.
These remarkable successes in the field of maternal and child health have been possible through our National Health Mission (NHM).
52% of India’s under-5 mortality is contributed to by deaths of newborns in the first month of life.
Under the NHM, our approach emphasises a continuum of newborn care both at the community and facility level.
Our focus has been to get pregnant women to have safe delivery in our institutions.
We launched an ambitious program – Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) – wherein incentives were given for delivering in public institutions to the beneficiaries directly.
This has directly contributed to reduction in maternal mortality.
We are fully aware that out-of-pocket expenses remain a key barrier for women to access timely health care and services.
This has helped to further improve our institutional deliveries.
More than 92 million mothers and 78 million children have already been registered so far in the system.
One of our major concerns is equity.
Special efforts are being made to put in more resources and focussed programmes in these areas.
One of the flagship programmes of my Government is the ‘Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan’ (The Clean India Campaign).
To save and educate the girl child we have launched an ambitious program – Beti bachao Beti padhao.
We need to ensure that the girl child survives, thrives and plays a very crucial role in society.
I have witnessed people getting poorer because of unfortunate health episodes.
We need to institutionalise a system where marginalised communities receive universal health care and financial protection.
We must experiment and learn from each other.
India stands ready to boost its commitment and partner with other countries and move forward on our promise to end maternal and child deaths and provide a better life to the adolescent.
I invite you, to commit to bold measures and hold each other accountable to these promises.
We also need to make a clarion call to the world to join hands in taking such steps that would ensure this.
It is my personal vision and my Government’s firm commitment.
While every country present here has something to offer, India also has a wealth of experience.
India has done well in many ways and would be extremely happy to share its experience with other countries.
Last year, I had made a commitment of assisting the SAARC countries in keeping it Polio free.
We have also made a commitment to provide Pentavalent vaccines to such SAARC countries as would need it.
We will offer whatever experience we have to the world community.
India would be happy to assist any country with technology, system strengthening and programme implementation capsules.
India’s rich experience in Universal immunization and particularly its experience this year with the Mission Indradhanush could be shared with all the countries.
We had offered this to SAARC countries earlier.
Today I repeat this offer to all countries present here.
This will be apart from our offer of support for Polio eradication.
I again warmly welcome you all to this important international Summit.
I hope the next two days would provide a new direction to the global community in its journey towards ending maternal and child deaths.
I wish you a pleasant stay in New Delhi.

Given our size and scale, India can become a pillar of global growth and stability.
cut in subsidies on fossil fuel and tax on coal; and, National Clean Energy Fund of US$3 billion to promote clean technologies.
With our highly ambitious/Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs),India would remain in step with the world.
We should shift from “carbon credit” towards “green credit”.
When we speak of targets, we must not only reduce the use of fossil fuel, but also moderate our life style.
Development in harmony with nature is the goal of my proposal to launch, along with the French President Hollande, an alliance of solar-rich countries at the time of COP-21 meeting.
Excellencies, let me conclude with a few points on development.
We are still short in our efforts to fulfill our last year’s commitment to raise our collective GDP by an additional 2% by 2018.
Clean energy and environment friendly infrastructure will address both development and climate change.
Bridging the current gap in infrastructure finance in the developing countries should remain our key priority.
I am happy with the focus on small holders and food losses in the G20 Action Plan on Agriculture.
I look forward to fruitful discussions and substantive outcomes.

I urge all parties to reject the motion that has been moved in the House
Today the nation has seen the negativity expressed by some members.
India saw how some people are so deeply opposed to development:
If you were not prepared for the debate why did you bring the motion?
Why were you trying to delay the motion
The only thing they have to say- remove Modi
What we saw among members of the Opposition was sheer arrogance.
Let me tell this member it is the people who elected us.
That is how we have come here:
What is his hurry to come to power?
In the morning, the voting was not over, the debate was also not over one member comes running to me saying- Utho Utho Utho…
To remove one Modi, see who all they are trying to bring together:
We are not here for selfish interests:
We are here because we have the blessings of 125 crore Indians.

Opening Statement by Prime Minister.
A very warm welcome to all of you.
Some of you have probably had the opportunity of visiting India before and for some probably it is the first time that you are visiting India.
I hope that for your comfort you have been well looked after here.
I know that there is an official programme but if you have any suggestion of what you would like to do here in addition to the programme that has been set up for you, that can be accommodated.
Of course for India it is very important given that we are the host country, but this is the first summit where all the 54 countries of Africa have been invited and all the 54 countries are participating.
The India-Africa Forum Summits have had two summits earlier, in 2008 and 2011, and now this is the 3rd India-Africa Forum Summit taking place.
Earlier the two summits were organised on the basis of the Banjul Formula, and in that sense very limited countries had come and participated.
But this time we decided to in fact come out of this formula and ensure that there was participation from all countries of Africa.
This I think is going to take relations between India and Africa to new heights.
There are going to be meetings at various levels, at the top level.
But in addition to you there are 400 journalists who are coming to cover this event from Africa and they are coming on their own with their own means.
I think this itself indicates the importance that is being attached to this summit.
From the discussions that I have been having with everyone, this summit in fact is attracting the focus of the entire world and people are in fact looking at it with great importance and I see this as a very good sign.
The relations between India and the countries of Africa, these relations and these bonds that we have, are not just political and economic but we also have a very rich cultural tradition.
It is said that millions of years ago in fact the two parts of the Earth were one piece and it was only much later that they became two separate pieces of land, one was Asia and the other was Africa; and we have an Ocean which divides us.
The west coast of India and the east coast of Africa in fact are linked by the sea.
Even today there are 270,000 Indians who live in Africa and many of them are Gujaratis.
I have always had relations with the African continent and whenever guests came they always met me.
I have always had very good relations with various personalities of Africa.
So, from a personal point of view I have always had very close links with this region.
In fact there are many similarities between India and Africa and together India and Africa we represent one third of the world’s population.
The population of India equals in fact the population of the entire African continent.
Africa in fact represents the youngest region in the world and India too is the youngest country.
The bilateral trade between India and Africa has been growing very rapidly and in the past few years it has grown by eight to nine times.
I feel that after this summit it is going to see another major jump.
In more than 40 countries today there are more than 100 projects which are under implementation.
In the same vein, India has invested 1.2 billion dollars in more than 100 institutes and this is contributing in a major way to human resource development.
For me I think the point which makes me the most happy is that there is this partnership between India and Africa that is human resource development, the capacity building.
Today in Africa many of the leaders who are now in power and in top position have had their education and training in India.
I think this also is a common factor between India and Africa.
Once again a very warm welcome to you.
I will also have the opportunity of greeting you during the summit once again.
Text of Prime Minister’s written interview with African journalists at the Editors Forum for 3rd India-Africa Forum Summit.
Question: What is the strategic importance of Africa to India in socio-economic and political terms?
Is India’s engagement with Africa a catch-up process with China in the scramble for resources?
Answer: The participation of all African countries, including over 40 at the level of Heads of State or Government, in the Summit is a testimony to the deep bonds of friendship and mutual faith between India and Africa.
This is a relationship that is beyond strategic considerations.
It is a relationship with a strong emotional link.
It has been forged by our intersecting history; our centuries-old ties of kinship, commerce and culture; our common struggle against colonialism; our quest for equality, dignity and justice among all people; and, our shared aspirations for our progress and a voice in the world.
We are blessed with vast reservoir of mutual goodwill and confidence.
India and Africa constitute one-third of the world’s population.
A large majority of them are in their youth.
Indeed, India and Africa will have a significant part of the global youth population in this century.
Their future will shape the course of this world to a great extent.
India and Africa are now the bright spots of hope for the global economy.
We have complementary resources and markets; and, the power of our human capital.
We have shared global vision.
Our relationship with Africa is unique and does not need any point of reference.
Question: How and to what extent have the relations between India and Africa helped in the development process of the African continent?
How is it a win-win situation for both?
Answer: Africa’s development in recent years has been impressive.
First and foremost, it is the result of African vision, leadership and efforts to strengthen peace and support economic development in the continent.
There are many inspiring models and examples of African success stories in sustainable development and empowerment of people, especially youth and women.
India is privileged to be a development partner for Africa.
From the time African nations started gaining independence, we have been supporting human resource development in African countries.
Our cooperation now takes many forms and is expanding rapidly in scale and range.
34 African countries now enjoy duty free access to the Indian market of 1.25 billion people.
We have committed grant assistance of USD 1.2 billion that is helping finance human resource development and establishment of over 100 capacity building institutions in Africa.
In the past three years alone, 25000 Africans have been trained or educated in India.
Indian tourist flow to Africa is also increasing.
The continent’s progress will add great stability and momentum to the global economy and benefit India as well.
Question: Some analysts say that the effects of colonialism and neo-colonialism are acting as an impediment to peace, stability and development of Africa.
What lessons does India hold in this regard for Africa?
Answer: India’s independence had a strong positive impact on anti-colonialism and freedom movements in Africa.
We are also proud to have stood firmly in the cause of independence of African countries and to end apartheid.
Africa does not need any lessons from us.
Colonial legacy left a long and deep impact on all of us.
Africa, too, has passed through difficult times.
However, Africa is making impressive progress now.
The continent is more settled and stable.
African nations are coming together to take responsibility for their development, peace and security.
Africans are exercising their franchise in increasingly large numbers.
We see growing efforts at economic reforms and regional economic cooperation and integration.
Economic growth has accelerated.
Around 95% of Africa is on mobile telephone now.
There are laudable initiatives on education, innovation, empowerment of women, skill development and conservation of Nature.
Of course, Africa continues to face many familiar development challenges.
Africa has a rich history of accomplishments; abundant natural resources; and, a large and talented youth population.
I have full confidence in the African leadership and the African people to realise the vision of “Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want”.
India will always be there, as a friend and partner, to share our experience, expertise and resources to support African nations in whatever manner they want.
Since many of our challenges are similar to what Africa faces, our solutions may be relevant in the African context.
Question: What can both India and Africa do to benefit from greater bilateral trade and investments?
What are the achievements in this sphere since the first India-Africa Forum Summit (IAFS-I) in 2008?
Answer: I see enormous opportunities for trade and investment ties between India and Africa.
India will be the most populous country and Africa the most populous continent in this century.
We both have young populations.
Africa is also blessed with huge resources.
Both India and Africa will grow, modernise and urbanise at a rapid rate.
Our economic partnership is gathering momentum.

In his address, the Prime Minister mentioned the emphasis that Mahatma Gandhi placed on cleanliness.
He recalled Mahatma Gandhi’s “Constructive Programme”, published in 1945, where rural sanitation was an important subject.
The Prime Minister said that an unclean environment, if not cleaned, leads to a situation where one starts accepting circumstances.
On the contrary, if one cleans up dirt in the surroundings, he gets energized, and then does not resign himself to existing adverse circumstances.
He said it was Mahatma Gandhi’s inspiration, that led to the Swachh Bharat Mission.
He added that inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, Indians have made the Swachh Bharat Mission the world’s biggest people’s movement.
He said that rural sanitation, which stood at 38 percent in 2014, has now reached 94 percent.
More than 5 lakh villages are now ODF, he added.

Rameshwaram is the land which has shown the way to the spiritual life of the country as a light house for thousands of years.
It is a great honour for me to touch this sacred soil of Rameswaram.
As home to one of 12 Jyotirlings of our country Rameswaram is not only a religious center.
In his actions and thoughts Dr Kalam always reflected the simplicity, depth and calmness of Rameswaram.
It is a very emotional moment for me to have come to Rameshwaram on the death anniversary of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.
Last year, we had made a resolution and had promised you that in the memory of Dr. Kalam, a memorial will be built in Rameshwaram.
I am happy that this resolution has been fulfilled today.
The Defense Research & Development Organization (DRDO) has prepared this memorial in a very short span of time.
This memorial will inspire the present and the future generations of the country.
But this is possible because today we have a government in Delhi which is committed to accomplish the tasks assigned by the people of our country.
This government has transformed the entire work culture and has successfully encouraged a time-bound work culture.
However, we should not forget that all the work was not done merely by the government, money, planning or power.
Then they used to rest for one hour from 5 to 6 p.m., had their evening tea, and then used to do work for extra time from 6 pm. till 8 o’clock.
And they said that they would not charge for overtime works between 6 to 8pm.
I bow to all my poor labourers who have fulfilled this sacred task with this devotion.
These workers, these craftsmen have done a great job and I urge all of you present here to applaud for them and give an standing ovation to them.
This memorial for Abdul Kalam ji in Rameshwaram is an example of the fact that whenever a labourer’s heart fills with the spirit of patriotism, great accomplishments are achieved.
She is a leader we all remember.
I believe her soul will continue to shower blessings for Tamil Nadu’s bright future.
Today, I want to request the people of the country from this holy land of Rameshwaram.
People from every corner of India come to visit Rameshwaram.
I request the tour operators, the visitors of Rameshwaram, and the young generation of the country that whenever you visit Rameshwaram, please visit this memorial for Abdul Kalam ji and inspire the new generation.
You must definitely come for this inspirational pilgrimage.
Today, our fishermen take small boats to the sea.
Under our scheme, our fellow villagers will get loan from the government, grant, and subsidy.

Rameshwar’s land is also associated with Lord Ramchandra ji.
And today I am happy that I got an opportunity to inaugurate the railroad Rameshwaram to Ayodhya, Shradhha Setu, a railway train linking Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Rama.
My congratulations to all the organizations working for Rameswaram’s future, especially the the Vivekananda Kendra.
The Indian Ocean and seven thousand five hundred kilometers long coastal line of India is full of investment potential.
Government of India has initiated the Sagarmala Project keeping it in mind.
Today’s youth want to build up on his or her own strength.
Government of India has started programs like Startup India, Standup India so that the youth can realize their dreams.
Training centres and skill development centres have been opened in every district of the country for the skill development of youth.
Centre has started Mudra Scheme so that the youth do not have to face the problem of capital for staring their own enterprise.
And, I’m happy that among the beneficiaries more than one crore people are from Tamil Nadu alone.
This figure shows the enthusiasm and inclination of the youth of Tamil Nadu towards the self employment.
Centre is focusing on the development of infrastructure in the state.
New India is not possible without a New Tamil Nadu.
That’s why the state government has been provided every help for the development of basic facilities.
Central government has released over Rs. 900 crore rupees for these cities; nearly one thousand crore rupees.
33 cities of Tamil Nadu have been included in the Amrit Mission.
In addition the centre has approved Rs.4700 crores for Tamil Nadu.
This money will be used in strengthening the facilities like electricity, water, sewage, cleaning and gardens in those 33 cities.
Central government has also approved the expansion of the first phase of Chennai Metro at a cost of nearly 4,000 crore rupees.
Besides the centre has released nearly 18,000 crore rupees in the last three years for the rural roads in Tamil Nadu, for the expansion of self-help-groups, for the skill development of rural youth.
And I’m hopeful that Tamil Nadu will not lag behind in this race and it will strive to achieve this goal..
I’d appeal to the state government to send the proposal, fast track the process of construction of the approved houses.
Dr. Abdul Kalam continued to work throughout his life to realize the dream of a developed India.
He always continued to inspire more than 1.25 billion citizens for achieving this goal.
Thank you very much to all of you.

Thereafter, I had visited Japan in 2016 for the Annual Summit.
Last year, I had the pleasure of hosting Prime Minister Abe and Mrs. Akie Abe in my home state Gujarat also.
Japan is India’s valued partner.
We have a Special Strategic and Global Partnership.
Our ties with Japan, both economic and strategic, stand completely transformed in recent years.
It is today a partnership of great substance and purpose.
It rests on the strong pillars of India’s Act East Policy, and our shared vision and commitment to a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.

We seek peace and prosperity for all.
Our complementarities make India and Japan a winning combination.

I feel specially privileged to visit this great institution in its 70th anniversary year.
And, through the sweeping change of these decades, through many challenges of our times, and the great progress of this era, the organization has endured and grown.
There have been doubts and skepticism.
There is need for urgent reforms.
But, for the Nations that came together at its birth; and, for three times as many that joined it later, there is one unshakeable belief:
“Our world is and will remain a better place because of the United Nations.”
It is this faith that has given birth to so many of its institutions that deal with every aspect of human challenges.
No organization serves our cause more than this one.
And, it draws strength from the basic character of Nature – the harmony and unity in diversity.
That is why UNESCO was among the first missions of the United Nations.
That is why India values the work of UNESCO so deeply; and, cherishes our partnership so immensely.
I am conscious of the extraordinary legacy of our relationship from the time of UNESCO’s birth.
I recall Mahatma Gandhi’s message to UNESCO, calling for urgent action to address the needs of education to secure lasting peace;
And, the leadership of Dr. Radhakrishnan, later our first President, in the early years of this institution.
We are grateful for UNESCO’s support for education and science, in India and for preservation of our cultural heritage.
Equally, we are privileged to have worked with UNESCO in support of its mission around the world.
For, in the challenges India faces and the dreams that Indians seek, our approach mirrors the ideals of UNESCO.
We have built a modern state in an ancient land, with a timeless tradition of openness and co-existence; and, a society of extraordinary diversity.
The foundation of our Constitution rests on a fundamental principle: the peace and prosperity of all is indivisible from the welfare of the individual;
For me, it means many things.
We will defend and protect the rights and liberty of every citizen.
Education always had a special place in our tradition.
And, this change must begin with the girl child.
So, the programme to educate and support the girl child in India is one that is closest to my heart.
We will ensure that they can go to school; and, also, that they can attend it in safety and dignity.
This is the most exciting change in our era.
And, we have launched a digital literacy mission to connect each of our 600,000 villages.
The link between habitat and fulfillment of human potential is deep and strong.
In the challenges of our times, we see its purpose with a sense of urgency.
The fault lines in our world are shifting from the boundaries of nations into the web of our societies and the streets of our cities.
The threats are changing from domination by states to destruction by groups.
We fight today not only over what we claim, but also for who we are.
And, in many parts of the world, culture remains a source of conflict.
We have access to communication at the click of a mouse.
We live in a world of information.
Yet, we know that familiarity does not always lead to fraternity; or reduce prejudice.
When Ebola threatens an entire region; the fury of unseasonal storms destroys crops and lives; and, diseases still defeat our most courageous fight, we understand how fragile we are.
When we see people living at the edge of existence; children shut out of classrooms; and, nations without the human resources to shoulder the responsibility of progress, we know that we still have a long way to go.
To be sure, our world has made incredible progress over seven decades.
So, our progress should inspire us to meet our challenges.
UNESCO can play a vital role in addressing them.
Culture must connect, not divide, our world.
It should be a bridge to greater respect and understanding between people.
It should join nations in peace and harmony.
Across India’s neighbourhood, Asia and Indian Ocean, we are retracing our cultural connections to form a closer bond of friendship in this dynamic region.
We must turn deep into our cultures; traditions; and religions; to overcome the rising tide of extremism, violence, and divisions across the world.
Cultures also hold great wealth of traditional knowledge.
Societies across the world have evolved them through wisdom gathered over the ages.
And, they hold the secrets to economic, efficient, and, environment friendly solutions to many of our problems.
But, today they are at risk of extinction in our globalised world.
So, we must here make more efforts to revive, preserve and nurture traditional knowledge.
We must do more to harness science for human welfare in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world – especially for health and food security.
Climate change is a pressing global challenge.
And, it calls for a collective human action; and, a comprehensive response.
In India, faith and Nature have had a deep link since ancient times.
For us, the only path to prosperity is the sustainable one.
We make this choice with the natural instincts of our culture and tradition.
But, we also do this with a commitment to our future.
We have, for example, set a target of adding 175,000 MW of clean and renewable energy in the next seven years.
Too often, our discussion is reduced to an argument about emission cuts.
But, we are more likely to succeed if we offer affordable solutions, not simply impose choices.
And, it is for the same reason that I call for a change in lifestyle.
Because, the emission reduction that we seek will be the natural outcome of how we live.
And, it will also mean a different path to economic well being.
It is with this vision that I had called the United Nations General Assembly last September to declare June 21st as the International Day of Yoga.
Yoga awakens a sense of oneness and harmony with self, society and Nature.
By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help us deal with climate change and create a more balanced world.
The campaign to clean our Ganges River is a mission that connects culture, science, traditional knowledge, education, economy, and, environment; but, it is also about attitudes and lifestyles.
It is a guiding spirit for the purpose of this institution – the defence of peace in the mind of men.
The 70th anniversary is a moment to celebrate our remarkable journey so far.
It is also a time to look ahead with wisdom that has come with time and experience.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has announced an ex-gratia relief of Rs. 2 lakhs each, from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund, for the next of kin of those who lost their lives in the floods dues to heavy rains in Tamil Nadu.

Not long ago, he mentioned, the “I” in BRICS (referring to the BRICS countries) was shaky, but today it is the strongest element of the BRICS.

Governor of Tamil Nadu,
Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,
Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,
My Ministerial colleagues,
Distinguished visitors,
A very good morning to you all!
This is the 10th edition of Def-Expo.
Some of you may have attended this event several times.
A few may even have been attending it since inception.
But for me, this is the first time at Def-Expo.
I am both delighted and over-whelmed to see such a keen gathering here in this historic region of Kanchipuram in the great State of Tamil Nadu.
I am very happy to be here in the land of the great Cholas who established India’s historic civilization links through trade and education.
This is the land of our glorious maritime legacy.
This is the land from where India Looked East and Acted East thousands of years ago.
It is wonderful to see over five hundred Indian companies, along with over one hundred and fifty foreign companies present here.
More than forty countries have sent their official delegations as well.
It is an opportunity like none other, not only to discuss India’s defense requirements, but also to show-case, for the first time ever, in such a manner, India’s own defence manufacturing capabilities to the world.
Armed Forces, the world over know the importance of supply chains.
But it is not just on the battle-fields, but also on the factory floors of defence manufacturing enterprises, that strategic decisions are made.
Today, we live in an inter-connected world.
The efficiency of supply chains is a key factor in any manufacturing enterprise.
Therefore, the strategic imperative to Make in India, to Make for India, and to Supply to the World from India is stronger than ever before.
Thousands of years of history of India shows that we have never desired any one’s territory.
Rather than winning countries through wars, India has believed in winning hearts.
In fact, from the time of Ashoka and even earlier, India has believed in using strength to protect the highest ideals of humanity.
In modern times more than one hundred and thirty thousand Indian soldiers sacrificed their lives in World Wars in the last century.
India had no claim on territory.
But Indian soldiers fought for restoring peace and up-holding human values.
Independent India has also sent one of the largest numbers of UN Peace-Keepers to places all over the world.
At the same time, an important responsibility of the State is to protect its own citizens.
The Great Indian thinker and strategist Kautilya wrote the Arth-shastra more than two thousand years ago.
He said that the King, or the ruler, must protect his people.
And, he also said that peace is preferable to war.
India’s defence preparedness is guided by these thoughts.
Our commitment to peace is just as strong as our commitment to protect our people and our territory.
And for this, we are ready to take all steps required to equip our Armed Forces, including through the establishment of a strategically independent defence industrial complex.
We are also aware/ that the defence manufacturing sector is unique in terms of government involvement.
You need the government to grant a license to manufacture.
Since the government is almost the only buyer in India, you also need the government to grant an order.
And, you need the government even to grant permission to export.
Therefore, over the last few years, we have made a humble beginning.
On defence manufacturing licenses, on defence offsets, on defence exports clearances, on Foreign Direct Investment in defence manufacturing, and on reforming our defence procurement, we have taken many steps.
Offset guidelines have been made flexible by allowing changes of Indian Offset Partners and offset components, even in contracts already signed.
Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers are now not required to indicate the details of Indian Offset Partners and products at the time of signing of contracts.
We have also re-instated Services as an avenue of discharging offsets.
The Standard Operating Procedure for issue of export authorizations has been simplified and put in public domain.
The requirement of Government-signed End User Certificate for export of parts and components and other non-sensitive military stores, sub-assemblies, and sub-systems has been done away with.
This is an increase of close to 30 percent.
I am sure that this will improve further in the years ahead.
Having said that, I am aware that we need to do a lot more.And, we are committed to do so.
We have also established a Defence Investors Cell to assist and handhold the investors involved in Defence Production.
Today, we have launched the ‘Innovation for Defence Excellence’ scheme.
India, with its leadership in Information Technology domain, would strive to use this technology tilt to its advantage.
Dreams transform into thoughts, and thoughts result in action”.
Our dream is to Develop the Ecosystem to Foster an Environment of New and Creative Entrepreneurship in the defence manufacturing sector.
We want to move fast.
But, we do not want to take short cuts.
There was a time when, like many other aspects of governance, the critical issue of defence preparedness was also hampered by policy paralysis.
We have seen the damage such laziness, incompetence or perhaps some hidden motives, can cause to the nation.
Issues that should have been long addressed by previous governments, are being resolved now.
You would have seen how the issue of providing bullet proof jackets to Indian Army soldiers was kept hanging for years.
And, you would have also seen that we have brought the process to a successful conclusion with a contract that will provide a boost to defence manufacturing in India.
You would also recall the long-drawn process of procurement of fighter aircraft that never reached any conclusion.
We have not only taken bold action to meet our immediate critical requirements, but have also initiated a new process to procure 110 fighter aircraft.
We do not want to spend ten years in discussions without any tangible outcomes.
Meaning, “In sandy soil, when deep you delve, you reach the springs below; The more you learn, the freer streams of wisdom flow.”
I am confident that Def-Expo will provide the opportunity to professionals and industry to find new meeting ground for developing military industrial enterprises.

As far as bilateral investments are concerned, till now Netherlands stands at the fifth largest source of Foreign Direct Investments.
In fact during the last three years it has become the third largest source of Foreign Direct Investments.
I don’t think there is any need to repeat the fact that in India’s economic development, in our priorities for development, Netherlands is a natural partner.
Today I will also have an opportunity to meet people of Indian origin living in the Netherlands.
The Indian diaspora here is a living link and bridge between the two countries.
It is also our endeavor to further strengthen these people-to-people contacts.

He said that along with awareness of human rights, citizens should also be aware of their duties and responsibilities.
He said those who understand their responsibilities, also know how to respect the rights of others.
There is a huge demand of aggregates in the housing and road sectors but there is significant gap in demand and supply, which can be reduced to a certain extent by recycling C&D waste.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you!
It is now a full three years since I started speaking to you over “Mann Ki Baat”.
This is the 36th episode today.
“Mann Ki Baat” has provided me with a unique opportunity to get connected with various feelings and positive energy of the country; emotions of our people which include their desires, expectations and at times, even grievances, which come to their minds.
And I have never said that these are the expressions of my mind; Mann Ki Baat reflects our countrymen’s minds, their expressions, their expectations.
And when I say things in Mann Ki Baat, people from across the country send their ideas, experiences and feelings to me.
Most of these are inspiring to me.
I just take half an hour of your time in a month but people keep sending suggestions, ideas and other material over Mann Ki Baat during all 30 days of the month.
And, the result of this whole exercise is that the government has started realizing the sensitivities and powerful ideas of the people of far off places.
And, this is why the three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is in fact a journey of our countrymen, their emotions and their feelings.
I am thankful to our countrymen for having provided me an opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one sentence of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
I surely believe and feel that now after three years, social scientists, universities, research scholars, media experts would undertake its analysis and highlight its every aspect, positive as well as negative.
And I am sure that this brainstorming could be useful for Mann Ki Baat in future and will infuse a new energy into it.
And, in one episode of Mann Ki Baat I had said that while having our food, we must also be conscious of consuming only as much as we need and see to it that there is no wastage.
Once, in Mann Ki Baat, I had mentioned about a retired teacher from Maharashtra Shriman Chandrakant Kulkarni who donated 51 post – dated cheques of Rs. 5,000/- each for the cleanliness drive out of his total monthly pension of Rs. 16,000/-.
And then I saw that a lot many people came forward to donate for this cause.
Once, I saw a selfie of a sarpanch with a daughter and referred to the same in Mann Ki Baat.
In no time, “Selfie with Daughter” became a big campaign not only in India but across the whole world.
Every parent started feeling that they should take a selfie with their daughter.
Every daughter started regaining her own self confidence & self esteem.
I was in a meeting with the Tourism Department recently.
I asked people who were planning to go travelling that where-ever they visit ‘Incredible India’, they must send photographs of those places.
Lakhs of photographs from every corner of India were received which actually became a treasure for those working in the tourism sector.
I’ve experienced through ‘Mann Ki Baat’ that even a tiny incident can launch a massive campaign.
Today I felt like sharing it, since I thought that it has been three years, and events & incidents over those three years ran across my mind.
The nation is always ready to move in the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the benefit of others, for social good, for the country’s progress.
This is what I gathered, learnt and understood from our countrymen during three years of the Mann Ki Baat campaign.
This is the most valuable capital and enormous strength for any country.
I heartily bow to my countrymen.
Sale of Khadi has increased and as a result of this, the poor man’s household has directly got connected to employment.
Discount is offered on Khadi from 2nd October and people get quite a good rebate.
I once again urge that we should try and take forward the Khadi movement.
We should follow the spirit of helping the poor to be able to light a Diwali lamp.
The poor of our country will derive strength from this and we must do it.
The increasing interest in Khadi has infused a new thinking in those working in the Khadi sector as well as those connected, in any way, with Khadi.
How do we bring in new technology, how do we increase productivity, how do we introduce looms driven by solar power?
How do we rejuvenate our traditional heritage which was lying inactive for 20, 25 or 30 years?
Sewapuri Khadi Ashram at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh was lying closed for 26 years but has got a fresh lease of life now.
A number of thoughts were implemented.
New employment opportunities were created for a number of people.
Khadi Gramodyog revived its training centre at Pampore in Kashmir and in this sector Kashmir has so much to offer.
With the reopening of this training centre, the new generation will get a boost in jobs in manufacturing , in weaving, in creating new things and it feels so good to see that even big corporate Houses have started including Khadi items as Diwali gifts.
Even people have started exchanging Khadi items as gifts.
We now experience how something grows naturally.
My dear countrymen, we had taken a resolve in last month’s Mann Ki Baat and had decided to observe a 15-day Cleanliness Festival before Gandhi Jayanti.
We shall connect people through cleanliness.
Our Honourable President inaugurated this programme and the country got connected.
The old or the young, men or women, city or village everyone has become a part of this Cleanliness campaign now.
And when I say “Sankalp Se Siddhi”, we can see for ourselves as to how a Cleanliness Campagin is advancing towards Sankalp Siddhi, that is Attainment through Reslove.
Everyone accepts this, co-operates in this and makes a contribution in realizing this.
A kind of a pressure has been created in public places and now people resist if someone tries to spoil or to make a public place dirty in any way and even those spoiling public places are also feeling this pressure.
This time a number of competitions were organized on the theme “Cleanliness is Service”.
More than two and a half crore children took part in an Essay Competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children made paintings.
They drew pictures based on their own imaginations.
Whenever there is a reference to cleanliness, I do not forget to express my gratitude to media persons.
They have taken this campaign in a religious manner.
We can see in “Swachhata Hi Sewa” movement as to how the electronic media and the print media in our country can render a big service to the country.
Just a few days ago some one drew my attention towards Bilal Dar, a young man of 18 years from Srinagar.
He clears plastic, polythene, used bottles, dry or wet waste – every piece of dirt from Aisa’s biggest lake near Srinagar.
He also earns from this activity.
Bilal is very young age wise but is a source of inspiration for all of us who are interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
The month of October is a month to remember so many of our titans.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, there are many great leaders who gave us the direction towards the 20th and 21st century, led us, guided us and faced so many hardships for the country.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deen Dayal ji.
And, what was the main focus of all these great men?
One thing was common and that was to live for the country, do something for the nation; they led the people not by mere sermons but by their actions.
Gandhiji, Jai Prakashji, Deen Dayalji were such great personalities who remained far away from the corridors of power but lived every moment for the people, kept fighting all odds following the principle “Sarv Jan Hitay – Sarv Jan Sukhay”, they kept endeavouring tirelessly.
India’s former President Shriman Abdul Kalamji used to speak of Nanaji’s contribution in rural development while talking to the youth.
He used to mention Nanaji’s contribution with great respect and he even went to a village to see Nanaji’s work there.
Like Gandhiji, Deen Dayal Upadhyayji also talked about the last person at the farthest fringes.
Deen Dayalji talked about the poorest of the poor the deprived, distressed ones and spoke of how, through education, employment or otherwise his life could be transformed.
We are not obliging these great men by remembering them but we remember them so that we may be able to foresee our forays into the future and the direction we choose.
The element of Unity in diversity being India’s speciality comes naturally to us.
We feel proud of diversity but have you ever tried to feel this diversity?
I would like to re-iterate to my countrymen, and specially to my young friends that we are alive & aware beings.
We should feel India’s diversity, touch it, feel its fragrance.
You may see for yourself, that for your inner development also, these diversities of our country work as a big teaching tool.
You travel around the world, I have no issues but have a look at your own country too.
People of North India may not be knowing what all is there in the South!
People of West India may not be knowing what all is there in the East!
Our country is full of such myriad diversities.
If you refer to Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekanand, our former President Abdul Kalamji then you will notice that when they toured around India, they got to see and understand India and they got inspired to do and die for the country.
All these great men travelled widely in India.
Can we make an effort as a student to learn, understand and try to live as per the traditions, culture, attire, eating habits and beliefs of different states, different societies, different groups of our country?
There will be a value addition in tourism only when we travel not only as a visitor but also like a student and make efforts to assimilate, understand & adapt.
This is my personal experience, I had a chance of visiting more than five hundred districts of India.
In more than four hundred & fifty districts, I had a night stay too.
And now, when I am shouldering this responsibility in India, that travel is coming in very handy and proving to be very useful.
That helps me a lot in understanding things.
I request you too, to feel the “Unity in Diversity” which is not a mere slogan but is a storehouse of enormous energy.
The dream of “Ek Bharat – Shreshtha Bharat” is inherent in this.
How many varieties of cuisines there are !
If we eat a new dish every day, we won’t have to repeat any variety throughout our life.
This is the power of our tourism.
Internalize India within yourselves.
Internalize the diversities of millions of denizens of India within you.
These experiences will enrich your lives.
Your vision will expand.
And, who can be a better teacher than experience!
Generally, October to March is the suitable time for tourism.
People travel.
I am sure that even this time if you go, you will lend further fillip to my campaign.
If you happen to meet people there, send their photos too.
Write not only about architecture or natural beauty but write something about their daily life too.
A thought comes to my mind, that in order to promote tourism in India what could be the seven best tourist destinations in your state – every Indian must know about these seven tourist spots of his state.
If possible, one must visit these seven places.
Can you provide some information about that?
Can you post on NarendraModiApp?
Can you post on #incredibleindia?
You see, if all the people of one state will do this, then I will ask the government to do a scrutiny of it and prepare publicity material based on seven common things received from each state.
In other words, how can tourist destination be developed keeping public aspirations in mind?
The Government of India will work on that.
The government will accept suggestions about making films, videos or preparing publicity material and about promoting that destination.
Come, get connected with me.
You can also act as a major catalyst in promoting the tourism of our country by utilizing the time from this October to March.
They leave a deep impression on my heart.
After all I am also a human being just like you.
You might have noticed one recent incident, a unique example of grit, determination and patriotism that was witnessed by all countrymen.
The Indian Army has got two extraordinary brave women officers; they are Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi.
Their husbands laid down their lives in the service of mother India.
One can imagine one’s agonizing mental state if her world gets shattered at such a early age!
But Swati Mahadik, the wife of martyr colonel Santosh Mahadik – resolved to face the difficult situations and she joined the Indian Army.
She received training for 11 months putting in great efforts and she put her life at stake to fulfill her husband’s dreams.
It is very natural for every countryman to have a deep sense of respect for these two bravehearts, our Matri Shakti.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to both of them.
They have evoked a new inspiration and a new awakening among millions of our countrymen.
Many congratulation to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is a big opportunity for our younger generation between Navratra festivities and Diwali.
FIFA under- 17 world cup is being organized in our country.
I am sure reverberations of the spirit of football will be heard all around.
It will evince more interest in Football in every generation.
There should not be a single school-college ground in India where we will not see our youngsters at play.
Come on, the whole world is coming to play on Indian soil, let us make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, Navratras are going on.
It is a time for praying to Ma Durga.
The whole environment is filled with sacred fragrance.
All around there is an atmosphere of spirituality, an air of festivities, an atmosphere of bhakti, of reverence.
This is revered as a festival of Shakti Sadhana.
This is also known as Sharadiya Navratri, the beginning of autumn.
On this pious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to our countrymen and pray to Ma Shakti to let our country attain newer heights so that the desires and expectations of all our countrymen get fulfilled.
May our nation be blessed with the strength to face any challenge.
My good wishes to all of you.
Celebrate festivities, enjoy with enthusiasm.

It is indeed a matter of great pleasure to be with you again.
Fewer things give greater joy than getting together with good friends to celebrate successful completion of joint initiatives.
You and I have been fortunate to have done so on important occasions in the past months.
In December last year, you and the Afghan people stood with me to inaugurate the Afghan Parliament.
The inauguration signaled and showed our joint commitment to strengthening the foundations of modern Afghanistan.
The India-Afghanistan-Iran transit corridor Agreement that we signed in May this year was another land mark in our partnership.
The Salma dam will revive and renew not just the economy and agriculture of the Herat region of Afghanistan.But will also build a strong and lasting pillar of support for Afghanistan’s overall growth and development.
Today’s video inauguration of Stor palace is an entirely different, yet in many ways more fundamental, dimension of our engagement.
I say this because it brings back to life a valuable landmark of Afghanistan’s cultural heritage.
The Stor palace has been the setting for many momentous historical events.
To those who cannot see beyond shadows of violence in Afghanistan, the restored Stor palace is a reminder of the glory of Afghanistan’s rich traditions.
Afghanistan is a close friend.
Our societies and people have had age old ties and links.
It, therefore, saddens us to see that your proud nation continues to be challenged by externally sponsored instruments and entities of violence and terror.
Let me assure the people of Afghanistan that in your quest:
• to build a prosperous Afghanistan; and • to bring peace, security and stability to your society;
the 1.25 billion people of India will always be on your side.
The pledge of our partnership and strength of our friendship with Afghanistan is unwavering .
Today’s event is a testimony to the resolve and range of our cooperative endeavours .
We want each Afghan to flourish and your society to be benefited from fruits of economic growth.
Whatever may be the odds, India will work with you for a bright future for all Afghans.
In the end, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and your Government for protecting Indian Embassy and Consulates and ensuring the safety and security of Indian experts working in Afghanistan.
The sacrifices made by our Afghan brothers will not be forgotten.
I once again thank you for your presence today.
I look forward to seeing you in person soon.
I also hope to have an opportunity to visit the renovated Stor palace someday.
Thank you, Thank you very much.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the passing away of Shri O P Mehra.
“Am pained on passing away of a brave and distinguished patriot, Shri O P Mehra.

Shri O P Mehra spent years in service of the nation, first in the Air Force and then through sports administration and as Governor of states.
My thoughts are with the family and all those whose lives Shri O P Mehra touched.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Cadre Review of the Indian Defence Accounts Service (IDAS) under the Ministry of Defence.
This was followed by the COP-21 where we contributed significantly in shaping the narrative.
Our commitments at COP-21 underline the Indian ethos which aims at changing human lifestyle along with changes in the manner in which we engage in economic activity.
The problems of environment are largely the effect of our consumptive lifestyles.
I have always felt that anything which is not sustainable cannot be called development.
This cannot happen unless the development process is inclusive and sustainable.
Anything which compromises on the ability of future generations to meet their requirements cannot be called development.
We in India have always believed in sustainability.
For us, the law of nature holds great value.
If we all observe it, then many man-made laws will not be required.
In modern terminology, there is a word called stakeholder.
A path becomes sustainable, if all stakeholders are benefitted.
It should be inherent.
It cannot be stretched to include those who may be working with ulterior motives.
Nature is pure.
Hence, only pure intentions can keep it intact.
We, in India, have a strong tradition of living in harmony with nature.
Moreover, in Indian mythology, most of the Gods and Goddesses are associated with an animal and a tree.
If we remember this, follow this and act accordingly, India could provide leadership in sustainable development.
For example, the practice of Yoga is aimed at balancing contentment and worldly desires, to lead to a path of moderation and sustainable lifestyle.
Much before the debate on sustainable development began, Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of our Nation, had said that we should act as ‘trustees’ and use natural resources wisely.
It is our moral responsibility to ensure that we leave a healthy planet for future generations.
We aim to do all this in a sustainable manner.
We realize that fulfilling the demand for energy is vital to the achievement of our development goals.
This is why, one of the first challenges that we took up was generation of 175 Giga watts of renewable energy.
We are well on our way to achieving this objective.
We have also taken up the Swacch Bharat and Clean Ganga Initiatives.
I am happy to note that millions of people across the country have joined the cleanliness drive.
I take this opportunity to invite the participants to explore as to how we can strengthen this collective endeavour.
Other civilizations have also faced similar problems and were able to overcome them.
I believe that through our collective efforts we will succeed as well.
While doing so, we must ensure that we avoid contradictions between our need to develop and develop sustainably.
Our culture teaches us Union between the व्यक्ति and समस्ती.
If we become one with the universal order, there are no conflicts of interest.
Therefore, my Government is treating the challenge of adapting to climate change as an opportunity rather than a problem.
This is what I mean when I talk of zero defect and zero effect manufacturing.
I have written some of my thoughts on this theme in my book, Convenient Action: continuity for change.
We need to recognize that there are many people who are least responsible for the problem of climate change.
They are also the people who still wait for access to modern amenities.
They face the adverse impact of climate change more than anyone else.
This includes cyclones, droughts, floods, heat waves, and rising sea levels.
The poor, vulnerable and marginalized groups have fewer resources to cope with climate disasters.
Unfortunately, their present and future generations are also burdened by laws and agreements on environment.
That is why I talk about Climate Justice.
Moreover, the rules, laws, practices and principles of one country cannot be applied to another uniformly.
Every country has its own challenges and its own ways of dealing with them.
If we apply the same set of rules for all countries and for all people; it will not work.
Sustainable development is our responsibility.
I am confident that we can achieve it, collectively.
Following is the text of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s message on Earth Day:
“Earth Day is a day of gratitude to Mother Earth and a day to reiterate our firm resolve to keep our planet clean and green.
We owe this to our future generations.
I congratulate the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Jee for presenting an excellent Budget.
The budget has provisions to fulfill the expectations of everyone- from construction of highways to expansion of I-ways, from the cost of pulses to the data speed, from the modernization of railways to simple economic constructions, from education to health, from entrepreneurs to industry, from textile manufacturers to tax deduction.
The Finance Minister and his entire team deserve praise for this historic budget.
Railways can now contribute in a much better way in meeting the transport needs of the country.
We have undertaken the exercise to launch Digital economy in a mission mode which will go a long way in achieving the target of 2500 crore digital transactions in 2017-18.
The Finance Minister has brought in tax reforms and amendments which will provide relief to the Middle Class, result in setting up of industries, create job opportunities , will put an end to discrimination and will provide incentives for private investments.
The move to reduce the personal income tax is significant as it touches the middle class most.
Bringing down the rate from 10 to 5 percent is a bold move.
Most of the taxpayers in India would be benefitted by this decision.
The small and medium industries across the country have been a major source of employment generation.
This budget is an important step towards overall development of the nation.
Once again, my heartfelt congratulations to the Finance Minister and his team for the budget.
The highlights of this scheme are as under:-
(i). There will be a uniform premium of only 2% to be paid by farmers for all Kharif crops and 1.5% for all Rabi crops.
In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid by farmers will be only 5%.
(ii). There is no upper limit on Government subsidy.
Even if balance premium is 90%, it will be borne by the Government.
(iii). Earlier, there was a provision of capping the premium rate which resulted in low claims being paid to farmers.
This capping was done to limit Government outgo on the premium subsidy.
This capping has now been removed and farmers will get claim against full sum insured without any reduction.
(iv). The use of technology will be encouraged to a great extent.
Remote sensing will be used to reduce the number of crop cutting experiments.
The new Crop Insurance Scheme is in line with One Nation – One Scheme theme.

He said the tribal carnival would showcase the capabilities of the tribal communities, in the national capital.

Yet, he added, the tribal communities had imbibed the ideals of community living, and of living cheerfully despite troubles.

In this respect, he added, the people living in urban areas can draw inspiration from them.
He said adivasis had the skills to make innovative products from local materials.
These could be in great demand, and create great economic opportunity, if marketed well, he added.

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, accepting the Fitness Challenge given by Virat Kohli, shared his fitness video today.
The Prime Minister said, “Here are moments from my morning exercises.
Apart from Yoga, I walk on a track inspired by the Panchtatvas or 5 elements of nature – Prithvi, Jal, Agni, Vayu, Aakash.
This is extremely refreshing and rejuvenating.
I appeal to every Indian to devote some part of the day towards fitness.
I begin ‘Mann Ki Baat’ today with a heavy heart.
10 days ago, Mother India had to bear the loss of many of her valiant sons.
These brave hearts made the supreme sacrifice in securing the lives of a hundred & twenty five crore Indians.
In order to ensure that their fellow countrymen could sleep peacefully, these brave sons toiled relentlessly, day or night.
As a consequence of the Pulwama terror attack and the sacrifice of the brave jawans, people across the country are agonized and enraged.
All around, there is a deluge of strong feelings of sympathy for the martyrs & their family members.
The outrage that singes your being and mine on account of the terrorizing violence replicates itself in the collective inner psyche’ of every citizen of the country; it also echoes in pro-humanity communities of the world, which sincerely believe in humanity.
I respectfully bow to all the brave sons of the country, who laid down their lives, protecting the honour of their motherland, India.
This martyrdom will keep inspiring us relentlessly to uproot the very base of terrorism; it will fortify our resolve.
We shall have to take up this challenge facing our country, forgetting all barriers of casteism, communalism, regionalism and other difference, so that, our steps against terror are firmer, stronger and more decisive.
Our armed forces have consistently displayed unparalleled courage and valour.
On the one hand, they have displayed exemplary capabilities in restoring peace; on the other, they have retaliated in equal measure, in a language the attackers understand.
You must have seen how within a hundred hours of the attack, retributive action was accomplished.
The Army has resolved to wipe out terrorists and their harbourers.
The martyrdom of these brave soldiers brought to the fore, through the media, touching, inspiring stories of their kin, whichgive hope and strength to the entire country.
The fortitude displayed by Ram Niranjanji, father of Martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, in this moment of tribulation is truly inspiring.
He has expressed the wish of sending his second son too, to take on the enemy; if need be, he himself would go and fight.
The country salutes the indomitable courage of Meenaji, wife of Martyr PrasannaSahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
She has vowed to send her only son to join the CRPF.
When the mortal remains of Martyr Vijay Soren, draped in the tricolor reached Gumla, Jharkhand, his innocent son iterated that he too would join the armed forces.
The mettle of this innocent lad is a representative sample of the feelings of each &every child of the Nation today.
Brothers and Sisters, about 12 lakhimpoverished families have benefitted from this scheme over a period of last five months.
I have found that it brings about a transformation in the life of the have-nots.
If you know a poor person who is unable to procure treatment due to lack of money, do inform him about this scheme.
In fact this scheme is meant for the benefit of such underprivileged people.
My dear countrymen, exam time in schools throughout the nation is soon going to dawn upon us.
In the next few weeks various education boards across the country will initiate the process for the board examinations of the tenth and twelfth standards.
My best wishes to all the students who’re going to appear for their examinations, their parents and all the teachers as well.
A few weeks ago, an immense event entitled ‘ParikshaPeCharcha’ was organised in Delhi in the format of a Town Hall programme.
In this Town Hall programme, I had the opportunity to talk with crores of students from India and abroad, and also with their parents and teachers; a possibility through the aegis of technology.
One of the focal points of ‘ParikshaPeCharcha’ was that there were lively interactions on various topics related with the entire process of examinations.
There are many such aspects which emerged out of these discussions which are definitely going to be beneficial for the students.
All the students, their teachers and parents can watch the recording of this entire event on YouTube, and I take this opportunity to wish all the best to all my’exam warriors’, for their upcoming examinations.
My dear countrymen, no mention of India can be complete without citing its festivals.
It is just not possible that a day passes without any significance associated with it, or does not herald a festival!
Our culture has a continuum spread over many millennia and it is a part of our heritage.
In a few days from now, Mahashivrartri will be celebrated, and that too on a Monday, and when a Shivratri falls on a Monday, it becomes all that special in our heart of our hearts!
I extend felicitations on this pious occasion of Mahashivratri to you all.
Many topics were discussed in their company and their confidence was really striking –it was inspiring.
I was very happy to hear that people not only listen to ‘Mann KI Baat’ but also remember it on many occasions.
I was really impressed with the prowess of that divyang young man.
My dear countrymen, connecting with all of you, courtesy the ‘Mann KiBaat’ program has been a really wonderful experience for me.
Through radio I connect every month with millions of families.
This has been a very sublime experience for me.
Friends, elections are the biggest celebration of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy in the hurly-burly of the general elections.
I myself will also be a candidate during this election.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave away the “Times Now” Amazing Indians Awards 2016.
The awards were given in recognition of great achievements in the face of adversity.
The Prime Minister regretted that in India, most of the narrative has been built around the lives of those in power, or the ruling class.
Those who have struggled and achieved noble objectives, or served society, despite severe obstacles and adversity, are rarely recognized and celebrated, he added.
The Prime Minister complimented Times Now for discovering and presenting to the world at large, the awardees for the day, and said their work would inspire many others.
He complimented the awardees for their achievements.
The NCSK was established in the year 1993 as per the provisions of the NCSK Act 1993 initially for the period upto 31.3.1997.
Later the validity of the Act was initially extended upto 31.3.2002 and thereafter upto 29.2.2004.

Though the Government has taken many steps for the upliftment of the SafaiKaramcharis, the deprivation suffered by them in socio-economic and educational terms is still far from being eliminated.
Further the practice of manual scavenging is still prevalent in the country and its eradication continues to be an area of the highest priority for the Government.

He added that that India would become great and healthy only when its 125 crore citizens are healthy.
Interacting with the beneficiaries, Shri Modi said that illness not only creates a huge financial burden on families, especially poor and middle class, but also affects our socio economic sectors.
Hence, it is the endeavour of the government to ensure affordable healthcare to every citizen.
Prime Minister added that Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojna was launched with this intention so that poor, lower middle class and middle class get access to affordable medicines and their financial burden is reduced.
Government has opened more than 3600 Jan Aushadhi Kendras all over the country, where more than 700 generic medicines are available at affordable price.
Talking about health stents, Prime Minister Shri Modi said that earlier citizens had to sell or mortgage property to purchase health stents.

The cost of heart stents have reduced from around Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 29000.
It is estimated that around 1 to 1.5 lakh knee operations happen in India every year.
On that account, the reduction in knee transplant prices has saved close to Rs.1500 crore for public.
Through Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Dialysis Program, Government has performed more than 22 lakh dialysis sessions for 2.25 lakh patients in more than 500 districts.
More than 3.15crore children and 80 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinatedin 528 districts through Mission Indradhanush.

Your Excellency Dr. Angela Merkel!
It is a great pleasure for me to join you in Bengaluru.
Welcome to this Indo German Summit.
I fondly recall my visit to the city of Hannover and Hannover Messe in April.
We are fortunate to be sailing in the right direction.
The recent data on global economic activity reinforces this assertion.
However, we cannot afford to be complacent.
We are committed to doing everything possible to convert these analyses into reality.
With a very open and global mindset, we have worked aggressively in the last fifteen months to make India an easy place to do business.
A recent study conducted with the help of the World Bank Group has brought out the urgency among our provincial governments on ease of doing business.
They are moving hand-in-hand with the federal government in this direction in a true spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism.
In fact the provincial governments have now entered into a healthy competition among themselves to ensure that a transparent, predictable and user friendly regulatory mechanism is quickly put in place.
One of the biggest challenges in India today is to productively employ our youth.
This percentage must reach around 25 in the short and medium term.
With this in view, we have launched the “Make in India” initiative.
To make it a success, apart from vigorous implementation of measures for ease of doing business, we have fast tracked approvals and clearances for industry and infrastructure.
Transparent auction and allocation of spectrum and of key natural resources like coal, iron ore and other minerals in the last 15 months have created a level playing field for investors.
We are aware that our domestic financial resources are not sufficient to meet our needs.
We have also refined our FDI Policy for construction and medical devices.
We have rationalized a number of other FDI related policy issues including bringing in the concept of composite sector caps for the FPIs and other investors.
We are keen to build futuristic physical and social infrastructure.
Through self-imposed discipline in the management of our financial resources, we have been able to allocate more resources for infrastructure sectors.
In addition, we are setting up an India Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
We have targeted an annual flow of Rs 20,000 Crore (which is approximately 2.7 billion euros) into this fund from our own resources.
We are putting in place a professional team for asset management.
We have also come up with the mechanism of Tax Free Infrastructure Bonds for projects in rail, road and irrigation sectors.
There were a number of regulatory and taxation issues which were adversely impacting on the sentiments of foreign investors.
We have taken very decisive steps to remove a number of long pending concerns of investors.
To give you some examples:-
• We have expedited regulatory clearances including security and environmental clearance;
• Across the board, we have increased the validity period of Industrial Licences;
• We have de-licenced a number of defence items and liberalised a number of restrictions like end-use certificate;
• We have increased the validity period of defence industrial licences up to eighteen years from three years;
• We have clearly articulated that we will not resort to retrospective taxation and reinforced this position by not going for imposition of Minimum Alternate Tax on FPIs;
• We have notified the regulations for the Alternative Investment Funds allowing foreign investments in such funds;
• We have rationalized the capital gains tax regime for Real Estate Investment Trusts;
• We have modified the Permanent Establishment norms;
• We are working on a new bankruptcy code; the Company Law Tribunal is soon going to be formed.
We want to make sure that our tax regime is transparent and predictable.
We are also keen to see that genuine investors and honest tax payers get quick and fair decisions on tax matters.
As a result of our initiatives, the sentiments for private investment and inflow of foreign investment have turned positive.
The growth rate of our GDP is above 7%.
FDI inflows have gone up by 40% compared with previous year’s corresponding period.
MOODY’s have upgraded the rating of India as positive.
India has improved its UNCTAD ranking of investment attractiveness.
Against 15th so far, now we are at 9th place.
India has also jumped 16 places on the World Economic Forum’s global competitive index after five years of decline in the list.
Similarly, in a ranking of the top global destinations for greenfield investment in the first half of 2015, India is at number one.
Foreign Policy magazine of USA has ranked India as number one FDI destination.
Thus, just in Fifteen Months, we have successfully restored the credibility of India in the eyes of global players.
I have always said that government has no business to do business.
We have taken several initiatives for transparency and online processing in IP administration.
A comprehensive National IPR policy is being finalized.
Last week I myself reviewed the situation.
I can say that this will be a progressive, and forward looking policy.
We want your active involvement in translating our dreams into reality.
Recently, we tried to ignite this energy through an interface of our youth with the eco-system of Silicon Valley.
India, in fact, is on the threshold of a big IT revolution.
We are at the tipping point where technology is going to be leveraged to meet the aspirations of our 1.25 billion citizens.
These initiatives provide additional avenues for investment in modern technology and human resources.
There is a huge domestic market in India.
Unlike a decade ago, talented young minds in India are no longer looking merely for high paying jobs.
We have witnessed exponential growth in the number of start-ups in the recent past.
Some of these have begun to challenge established global players.
To conclude, I can assure you that we will be open to welcome your ideas, innovations and enterprises.
I had said in Hannover and I am saying it again, that we are also open to carry out necessary corrections in our policies and procedures.
I can say that, never before, India was so well prepared to absorb talent, technology and investment from outside.
To our understanding, the necessary conditions to propel the Indian economy to a high growth trajectory do exist today.
I am eagerly looking forward to working with you.
Therefore, it makes strong business sense to be in India.
It makes even better business sense to Make in India.
Thank you very much!

Business Leaders from both countries;
My personal engagement with the leadership, Government, Industry and people of Japan is now a decade old.

I am also happy to see that dedicated townships, clusters and institutions have come up to make the Japanese life and work experience better.
Today also, one Japanese township has been announced.
Gujarat’s Industry and Government still cherish the fact that Japan became the first partner country in the Vibrant Gujarat event.
Not only did this partnership continue, but our engagement has kept growing.
It has resulted in much greater level of engagement of the Japanese industry with the Indian economy.
I thank Keidanren, JETRO and other organisations for helping us in this process.
The mechanism of Japan Plus has also helped in the process of hand holding.
The Government and the people of Japan have always shown great affection towards me and my country.
In fact, 1.25 billion people of India have the same affection for the Japanese people.
I am particularly grateful to Prime Minister Abe for his encouragement and support at a personal level.
Prime Minister Abe and I do not miss any opportunity to meet.
Similarly, the number of Japanese companies working in India has gone up steadily in the last few years.
From the activities launched today, you can see the depth of relationship between the two countries.

Apart from Gujarat, they are located in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
In addition to Gujarat, they will be developed in Karnataka, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu.
• You know that the ancient and holy city of Varanasi is my second home.
The project of Varanasi Convention Centre is a symbol of cultural co-operation between Kyoto city of Japan and Varanasi.
It was conceived by Prime Minister Abe and I when we visited Varanasi together in 2015.
I have named it Rudraksh – the symbol of love, and a Prasad of Lord Shiva to Humanity.
This Rudraksh will be a gar-land of love of Japan for Varanasi.
It will also be a tribute to our shared Buddhist heritage present at Sarnath too.
We have concluded a number of agreements on very important matters.
All this shows the depth of our understanding and the comfort and confidence which we have with each other.
Over the last three years, we have worked very hard on the front of Ease of Doing Business.
A series of administrative reforms have significantly improved the business sentiment in the country.
These reforms and initiatives are all aimed at preparing India for the 21st century.
They are aimed at transforming the country and making a New India.
Powered by the energy of our youth, we are positioning India as a global manufacturing hub.
For this purpose, we have launched the ‘Make in India’ campaign.
For the same purpose, we have started the Start-up India campaign.
The Start-Up India initiative also aims to build a strong eco-system of innovation.
This includes 100 Smart Cities Mission, Housing for 50 million homeless, building roads, bridges, ports, railways tracks as well as stations.
Japan can benefit tremendously with the size and scale of our potentials and skilled hands that India offers!
Every day we are making it easier to invest and do business in India.
We have already resolved a number of regulatory and policy issues facing the businesses and companies.
We have got very good results of these efforts.
India’s biggest tax reform, the GST has been introduced recently.
Today, India has one of the most liberal FDI regimes in the world.

FDI flows from Japan have almost tripled in last three years.
The new Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code will make it easier for investors to have an exit.
We are setting up commercial courts and commercial divisions to ensure speedy disposal of commercial matters.
Arbitration proceedings will now become faster as the Arbitration law has been amended.
We have also announced a new Intellectual Property Rights policy.
India and Japan are ancient civilizations and vibrant democracies.
We know how to distribute the fruits of progress and prosperity to the common man.
I have been saying that 21st Century is Asia’s Century.
I have also been saying that India and Japan will play a major role in Asia’s emergence.
The growing conver-gence between India and Japan on strategic and economic issues has the capacity to stimulate the global economy.
I am confident that Strong India and Strong Japan will also be a stabilising factor in Asia and the world.
In this mutual and global pursuit I thank Prime Minister Abe and Japan for being a perfect partner.

The MoU was signed in New Delhi on 9th July 2018 during the visit of the President of South Korea to India.
I am happy to be part of this new beginning for Smart Governance in the North East.
The launch of Integrated Command and Control Centres in Gangtok, Namchi, Pasighat, Itanagar and Agartala is a welcome step.
The urban centres of the North East, with their pool of skilled human resource, have the potential to emerge as growth hubs for the entire region.
The Smart City Mission enables cities to identify their potential and challenges.
It catalyses smart solutions for the challenges, through public consultation.
Smart City Command and Control Centres use digital technology to integrate different service networks.
They enable real-time collaboration among departments such as Police, Transport, Power, Water, Sanitation, and Public Safety utilities.
I believe that with the system in place, administrators will be able to monitor city operations better and respond in real time.
The implementation of Integrated Command and Control Centres is gathering pace across India.
As on the First of March 2019, these Centres have already become functional in fifteen Smart Cities.
Work is in progress at fifty other Centres.
I am told that the North-East will have its first completed Smart Command and Control Centre as early as October 2019.
One of the key components of the system is the CCTV Surveillance system for Citizen Safety.
This system is designed to help tackle crime.
The Intelligent Traffic Management System will help ease traffic flow.
The Solid Waste Management component in the Command and Control Centre will boost cleanliness in these cities.
Smart Street Lighting will make our streets safer and citizen friendly.
It will also improve energy efficiency through the conversion to LED systems.
Smart cities are also installing Public-Address Systems and Variable Message Signs to communicate important civic information.
Digital access is an important component of Digital India Mission.
Public Wi-Fi system will provide free internet access to Citizens.
The North-East is an environmentally sensitive region.
The Environmental Monitoring System and Disaster Management modules will give real time information to Citizens and Government.
It will help improve the overall quality of life of Citizens.
As cities start implementing and expanding the different elements of this system, they will be able to improve Ease of Living for their citizens.
I am told that there are over 500 projects with a total worth of nearly 15,000 crore rupees in the ten Smart Cities in the North East.
Work orders have already been issued for 59 of these projects.
I am happy to see Namchi in Sikkim, begin work on its Integrated Water Supply projects, LED Street lights and footpaths.
Water is becoming a huge challenge in our hill cities.
Gangtok has started work on rain water harvesting.
The city administration has taken up projects to manage the same under the Smart Cities Mission.
Itanagar has plans to improve its city road network through its Smart Roads and Intelligent Traffic and Transport Management system.
Pasighat is addressing the challenges of housing, energy management and business development through key Smart City projects.
So, each city has identified its key problems and is moving towards finding solutions to these problems.
I am happy to note that the other five North Eastern cities of Guwahati, Aizawl Kohima, Imphal and Shillong are also moving in this direction.
Project implementation under the Smart Cities Mission is now gathering pace.
I am confident that we are fast progressing towards urban transformation of our North Eastern cities.
The Cabinet has also approved the proposal to allow foreign portfolio investors to acquire shares through initial allotment, besides secondary market, in the stock exchanges.
The move will help in enhancing global competitiveness of Indian stock exchanges by accelerating/facilitating the adoption of latest technology and global best practices which will lead to overall growth and development of the Indian Capital Market.

Shalom le kulaam ani semya mayodh lehiyot po (I am delighted to be here in Israel.)
It is my singular honour to be the first ever Prime Minister of India to undertake this ground breaking visit to Israel.
They have nurtured it with hard work, grit and the spirit of innovation.
You have marched on regardless of adversity and converted challenges into opportunity.
India applauds your achievements.
Today is July 4, exactly 41 years since Operation Entebbe.
Your heroes are an inspiration for the younger generations.
India is a very old civilization but a young nation.
800 million people in India fall below 35 years of age.
The talented and skilled youth of India are also its driving force.
They propel my vision to transform India, its industry, its economy, its way of doing business, and its interface with the world.
In our path of sustained high growth and all around development, India counts Israel among its important partners.
The need to rely on science, technology, innovation, and higher technical education to overcome our developmental challenges is common to both of us.
These domains also bring together the creative energy and ideas of the highly skilled youth and entrepreneurs of the two countries.
Alongside building a partnership for shared economic prosperity, we are also cooperating to secure our societies against common threats such as terrorism.
A progressive partnership in all these areas would shape the scope of my conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu.
A journey that we are excited to undertake together for the good of our people and societies.
As we march together, a strong and resilient partnership with Israel will be my intent and focus.
I thank you once again for this tremendous welcome.

I am happy to be here today to address the delegates of the sixth Global Focal Point Conference on Asset Recovery, and the Annual Conference of CBI and State Anti-Corruption Bureaus.
I also extend a warm welcome to the delegates from abroad who are attending this Conference.
I hope that your visit to India is pleasant and memorable.
I also congratulate the officers of CBI who have received medals for distinguished service today.
Governments across the world work to transform the lives of the poor and the marginalized.
Corruption is one of the principal challenges to that objective.
We in India are currently in a crucial phase of Nation building.
Our mission is to build a prosperous India.
• our farmers are capable;
• our workers satisfied;
• and our youth self-reliant;
This is not an impossible mission.
However, to achieve this objective, it is essential to fight relentlessly against corruption.
India stands committed in its fight against corruption.
My Government has taken significant steps to check corruption and the menace of black money in a short span of time.
The very day that we assumed office, we constituted a Special Investigation Team under the supervision of the Supreme Court to look into the issue.
We have entered into agreements with many countries for exchanging real time information on black money.
The Government has signed the Inter Government Agreement with the United States to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.
This Agreement enables Indian tax authorities to receive financial account information of Indians from foreign countries on an automatic basis.
A comprehensive and deterrent law, the Black Money Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets and Imposition of Tax Act has been enacted.
It provides for stringent penalties and prosecution.
We have also introduced a provision under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for restitution of assets.
This will enable millions of poor investors who have lost money in ponzi schemes to recover a part of their hard earned money.
I hope that the partnership between Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR) and Interpol will help in confiscation and recovery of stolen assets.
This has brought about transparency in the system and restored faith of the citizens in Government.
It has also generated substantial revenues for the government which will benefit our people.
We are focused on providing system based and policy driven governance.
A governance structure that is sensitive, transparent and accountable.
Let me share an example to illustrate how corruption can be eliminated silently and efficiently by simple technology and policy based initiatives.
When we assumed office, I was informed that cooking gas cylinders were being subsidized to the tune of approximately four hundred rupees per cylinder.
This subsidy was being provided to rich and poor alike.
We decided that the subsidy should be credited directly into bank accounts of consumers with each account being linked to a unique Aadhaar card.
This single intervention has reduced the number of registered consumers claiming gas subsidy by about fifty million.
Subsequently, we also launched a campaign for the “well off” to voluntarily give up cooking gas subsidy.
The response has been very encouraging.
As on date, more than 4.5 million people have given up their gas subsidy.
One of the challenges that we must address is Governance Deficit.
This includes:-
• inadequate capacity to deliver public services effectively and efficiently,
My Government has taken several steps to make the bureaucracy more efficient performance-oriented and accountable.
The Government is committed to ensuring probity among public servants and to protect them from frivolous allegations.
Equally, the Government is unsparing when it comes to punishing the corrupt.
We have so far removed and ensured pension cuts of 45 senior officers of various services for unsatisfactory performance and delivery in public service.
Globalization of organized crime poses a major threat to economies throughout the world.
It is a well-known fact that ‘dirty money’ drives out ‘good money.’
Organized crime can hamper investment and economic growth.
It can also infiltrate or acquire control of large sectors of the economy.
Illicit funding promotes organized criminal activities like drug trafficking, arms trafficking, human trafficking, and terrorism.
The dastardly acts committed in Paris a few days ago are a grim reminder that terrorists have shown remarkable flexibility and adaptability in meeting their funding requirements.
Disrupting fund flows constrains the capabilities of terrorists and reduces their ability to execute attacks.
This involves putting in place both systemic safeguards, and targeted economic sanctions based on credible counter-terrorism intelligence.
Targeting proceeds of crime is an important element in this fight against crime.
Hence, there is an imperative need to focus our efforts to enhance international cooperation in the field of Asset Recovery for fighting crime, corruption and terrorism.
In fact, Kautilya in his‘Artha Shastra,’ had suggested confiscation of illegitimate income as one of the punishments for corrupt public servants.
I am also pleased to note that the heads of State Anti-Corruption Bureaus and CBI will deliberate on the related theme of tracking proceeds of corruption.
This two decade old forum must not only focus on prosecution of offenders involved in corruption but also modify their Standard Operating Procedures to more effectively target the proceeds of corruption.
Investigation agencies are limited by national boundaries.
Our Government is committed to the implementation of a uniform global standard on Automatic Exchange of Information, on a fully reciprocal basis.
This will facilitate exchange of information regarding persons who have concealed their money in offshore financial centres and tax havens.
INTERPOL is playing an increasingly active role in asset recovery.
Since 2009, Global Focal Point Forum is actively promoting the exchange of corruption data among law enforcement agencies and anti-corruption entities worldwide.
The new INTERPOL notice could add value to asset-tracing investigations and facilitate real time information sharing in complex cases.
I appreciate the efforts of INTERPOL and its partners – World Bank and UNODC – in conceiving the idea and giving leadership to this forum that has the potential to put an end to safe havens for the corrupt.
I am told that the excellent and proactive cooperation between INTERPOL and Indian investigative agencies has resulted in tracking of many fugitive criminals and their subsequent deportation or extradition.
I would like this cooperation to deepen.
CBI has been effectively assisting the Indian law enforcement agencies and their foreign counterparts in overcoming the barriers that complicate the exchange of investigative information.
I am also informed that CBI has been making use of INTERPOL tools and databases for securing greater cooperation among law enforcement organizations throughout the world.
It has also been consistently partnering INTERPOL Capacity Building Programmes.
We are in the process of establishing an International Centre of Excellence in Investigation at Ghaziabad.
This Centre will render world class Certified Courses on Investigation and Prosecution in specialized and emerging domains of crime including cybercrime, to the Law enforcement community of India and abroad.
A Centralized Technology Vertical to focus on combating new age crimes like cybercrime, is also being planned.
There are several cases in the annals of Indian judicial history in which conviction was secured solely on the basis of forensic expert opinion.
India must, therefore, have adequate facilities to be able to clear the huge backlog of forensic opinion.
The proceeds of crime and corruption are stolen assets.
They do not belong to the country where they are stashed.
They rightfully belong to the citizens of the country from which they have been plundered.
I am well aware of the legal and procedural obstacles and differences in evidentiary standards that hinder Asset Recovery.
To overcome these challenges, Police and Law Enforcement Agencies should forge formal and informal relationships.
I hope this conference provides all of you such an opportunity.
I also hope that the delegates will seriously deliberate and devise proper procedures and protocols to quicken the process of tracing, identifying, restraining, confiscating, and repatriating the stolen assets.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
A few hours later, the year will change, but this sequence of our conversation will go on, just the way it is.
We will renew this exchange of thoughts on newer topics in the year to come, we’ll share new experiences.
Heartiest New Year greetings to all of you.
Over the last few days, the festival of Christmas was celebrated across the world with gaiety and fervor.
People in India too celebrated Christmas with warmth and cheer.
The pious occasion of Christmas reminds us of the great teachings of Jesus Christ who laid much emphasis on the spirit of service, ‘Sewa bhaav’.
The essence of the spirit of service can be felt in the Bible too.
This conveys the immense significance attached to the sanctity of service.
Be it any religion, caste or creed, tradition or colour in this world; the spirit of service is an invaluable hallmark of the highest human values.
Come, let us remember great men & their ideals; let us be reminded of the essence of holy occasions; let us infuse a new awakening, a new drive into our great value system.
Let us try & live, abiding by them.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th ‘Prakash Parv’ of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
A guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, Guru Gobind Singh ji, in all these roles, performed the great task of inspiring people.
In every moment of his life, the message of love, sacrifice & peace was palpable.
His personality was filled to the brim with the greatest of virtues.
I’m fortunate that at the beginning of this year, I got an opportunity to participate in the 350th birth anniversary celebration organized at Patna Sahib.
Come, let us all resolve to imbibe & abide by lessons from his great teachings & exemplary life and mould our own life in accordance with them.
The 1st of January, 2018, i.e. tomorrow, in my view, is a special day.
You’ll be surprised, since the New Year comes every year, the 1st of January arrives every year!
But, when I refer to it as special, I really mean it as special.
The power of the vote is the greatest strength of a democracy.
The vote is the most effective tool in bringing about a positive change in the lives of millions of people.
You too can be the makers of 21st century India and this opportunity comes into being, very specially, on the 1st of January.
And today, in this edition of Mann Ki Baat, I wish to speak to our successful young men & women between 18 & 25, all infused with energy and resolve.
I consider them ‘New India Youth’, ‘New India Youth’ stands for aspirations, enthusiasm & energy.
I firmly believe that the dream of our ‘New India’ will be realized through the skill & fortitude of these energetic youth.
In the New India everyone will have equal opportunity and aspirations and wishes of everyone will be fulfilled.
New India will be a place where peace, unity and amity will be our guiding force.
My New India Youth should come forward and deliberate on how this New India would be formed.
One should decide one’s own path and also decide a way for connecting along those attached to one and the Caravan should get going.
You should move forward and thus should the country move ahead.
Right now, while taking to you I got an idea whether we could organize a mock parliament in every district of India?
Where the youth between 18 and 25 could sit together and brain storm about new India, find ways and chalk our plans.
How could we realize our resolves before 2022?
How could we build an India of the dreams of our freedom fighters?
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom movement into a mass movement.
I propose that a mock Parliament be organized around the 15th August in Delhi comprising one young representatives selected from every district of India who would participate and deliberate on how a new India could be formed in the next five years.
How can resolve be transformed into reality?
Today, a lot of new opportunities have been created for the youth.
Our youth are coming forward in areas like skill development, innovation and entrepreneurship and are achieving success.
I wish that the New India Youth get information and details of all these new opportunities and plans at one place and a system be created so that every young person on turning 18 should automatically get to know all this and benefit from it.
My dear countrymen, I had talked about positivity during the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat.
I am reminded of one Sanskrit Shloka-
In English too, it is said, ‘Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power’.
During the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen to share their positive moments of 2017 and to welcome 2018 in a positive atmosphere.
I am very glad that a large number of people gave positive responses on social media platform, MyGov and the Narendra Modi App and shared their experiences.
Lakhs of tweets were posted on Positive India hashtag (#), which reached out to more than nearly 150 crore people.
In a way, a wave of positivity which emanated from India spread all over the world.
All tweets and responses received were really inspiring.
It was indeed a delightful experience.
Some countrymen shared those incidents of this year which left a special impact on their minds, a very positive one at that.
Some people even shared their personal achievements.
I reside in Mayur Vihar, Pocket-1, Phase- I, Delhi.
# My name is Jyoti Rajendra Waade.
I am speaking from Bodal.
One rupee per month was being deducted towards insurance premium which my husband had subscribed to.
He died in an accident.
Only we know of the situation we faced at that time.
Assistance from the government helped us a lot and I could gather the strength to stand myself.
A national highway has been constructed in 2017 through our village Bhinnar.
As a result of this, our roads have improved a lot and business there will surely get a boost.
In fact, this is the New India which we are all collectively building.
Let us enter into the New Year with such little achievements, begin our New Year and take concrete steps in the journey from ‘Positive India’ to ‘Progressive India’.
When we all talk of positivity, I also feel like sharing one experience.
Recently, I came to know about the inspiring story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak who is a topper in Kashmir Administrative Service Examination.
He actually extricated himself from the sting of terrorism and hatred and topped in the Kashmir Administrative Examination.
You will be surprised to know that terrorists had set his ancestral home on fire in 1990.
Terrorism and violence were so widespread there that his family had to leave their ancestral land and flee from there.
For a young child, such an atmosphere of violence could easily create darkness and bitterness in the heart, but Anjum did not let it be so.
He chose a different path for himself – a path of serving the people.
He overcame the adverse situation and scripted his own success story.
Today, he has become a source of inspiration not only in Jammu & Kashmir but for the youth of the whole country.
Anjum has proved that however adverse the circumstances be, the clouds of despair and disappointment can easily be cleared by taking positive steps.
Just last week, I had a chance of meeting some daughters of Jammu & Kashmir.
I talked to them, there was no sign of despair; there was only enthusiasm, optimism, energy, dreams and a sense of resolve.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a reference to famous religious places, not only of India but of the whole world, it is very natural to mention about the Sabrimala temple of Kerala.
Millions of devotees come to this world famous temple, seeking blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami.
It is a huge challenge maintaining cleanliness around such a large religious place where devotees in such huge number come.
And especially, since this place is situated in the midst of hills and forests.
And, he began a tradition that the yatra of devotees will remain incomplete if they do not contribute by performing some physical labour or the other in the cleanliness programme.
No one is big or small in this campaign.
Every devotee considers doing physical labour in the cleanliness drive as a part of the Lord’s worship.
Every morning, there is a uniquely pleasant scene of cleanliness here when all devotees join in the drive.
Here, a strong resolve of maintaining cleanliness also is as important as the strict discipline observed during worship.
Efforts in the direction of cleanliness are being widely taken across the whole country.
A change can now be seen in the form of public participation in rural and urban areas alike.
Cleanliness Survey 2018, the largest in the world, will be conducted from the 4th of January to 10th of March, 2018 to evaluate achievements in cleanliness level of our urban areas.
This survey will cover a population of more than 40 crores in more than four thousand cities.
Separate teams will go to cities for inspection.
And take the full onus to ensure that your city should not lag behind and your street or mohalla should not look to be wanting.
I am very sure that using blue and green dustbins to collect dry and wet garbage respectively must have become your habit by now.
Let us all, once again remembering revered Bapu and taking a resolve to build a Clean India, put in our best endeavours.
My dear countrymen, there are a few things which appear small but they have a far reaching impact on our image as a society.
Today, in this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you.
It has come to our notice that if a Muslim woman wants to go on Haj Pilgrimage, she must have a ‘Mehram’ or a male guardian, otherwise she cannot travel.
When I first heard about it, I wondered how it could be possible!
Why this discrimination?
And when I went into the depth of the matter I was surprised to find that – even after seventy years of our independence, we were the ones who had imposed these restrictions.
Even in many Islamic countries this practice does not exist.
But Muslim women in India did not have this right.
And I’m glad that our government paid heed to this matter.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs issued corrective measures and we ameliorated this restriction by phasing out a tradition that had been in practice for the past seventy years.
Today, Muslim women can perform Haj without ‘mahram’ or male Guardian and I am happy to note that this time about thirteen hundred Muslim women have applied to perform Haj without ‘mahram’ and women from different parts of the country from Kerala to North India, have expressed their wish to go for the Haj pilgrimage.
I have suggested to the Ministry of Minority Affairs that they should ensure that all women who have applied to travel alone be allowed to perform Haj.
Usually there is a lottery system for selection of Haj pilgrims but I would like that single women pilgrims should be excluded from this lottery system and they should be given a chance as a special category.
I not only reiterate this wholeheartedly but it is my firm belief that the journey of India’s progress has been possible due to women-power and on the basis of their talent and we will continue to march onwards on this path of progress.
It should be our constant endeavor that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities just like men get so that they can proceed simultaneously on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for all of us.
But 26th January, 2018, will especially be remembered through the ages.
This is unprecedented in India’s history.
The year 2017 has been special for both ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years of formation in 2017 and in 2017 25 years of India’s partnership with ASEAN were completed.
On 26th January the arrival of great leaders of 10 nations of the world as a unit is a matter of pride for all Indians.
May the New Year bring greater happiness, glad tidings and prosperity for all of you.
Let us move forward with all renewed zeal, enthusiasm, fervor and new resolve.
The month of January is the period of the northward movement of the Earth on the celestial orbit around sun and in this month Makar-Sankranti is also celebrated.
This is a festival linked with nature.
Though all of our festivals are associated with nature in one way or the other, but in our country blessed with the bounty of cultural diversity, there are different ways to celebrate this wonderful episode of nature in different forms.
These festivals may have different names, but their origins stems from attachment to nature and agriculture.
Felicitations to all of you on the occasion of these festivals.
And once again, best wishes for the New Year 2018 to all of you.
I thank you my dear countrymen.
We have gathered at a very auspicious time.
Yesterday my Telugu sisters and brothers celebrated the festival of Bhogi.
Friends in the northern part of India, especially Punjab marked Lohri.
Today is Makar Sankranti.
The people of Assam are celebrating Magh Bihu.
And in Tamil Nadu, where you are, it is Pongal.
Pongal is the festival of thankfulness – thanking the sun god, thanking the animals that help in agriculture and thanking nature for providing the natural resources that sustain us.
Harmony with nature is the strength of our culture, our traditions.
From north to south, east to west, we can see how there is a festive spirit across the nation.
Festivals are celebrations of life.
With festivals comes a spirit of togetherness.
They weave a beautiful thread of unity.
My greetings to people across India on all these festivals.
Makar Sankranti marks the transition of the Sun into the zodiac sign of Makara Rashi on its celestial path.
For most people, Makar Sankranti means a break from the harrowing winter and warmer, brighter days.
Some of the festivals we celebrate today are harvest festivals.
We pray that these festivals bring prosperity and joy in the lives of our farmers, who work hard to keep our nation fed.
I pay my tribute to my dear friend Sri Cho Ramaswamy on the 47th anniversary of Thuglak.
In the passing away of Cho, we all have lost a friend who offered his invaluable wisdom to whoever came his way.
I knew him personally for over four decades.
It is a personal loss for me.
Of all his roles, his role as the editor of the Thuglak magazine was the jewel in the crown.
For 47 years the Thuglak magazine played a stellar role in the cause of safeguarding democratic values and national interest.
Thuglak and Cho – it is difficult to imagine one without the other.
For nearly five decades, he was in charge of Thuglak.
If someone has to write the political history of India, he cannot write it without including Cho Ramaswamy and his political commentary.
His greatest achievement is that he made Thuglak a weapon against all divisive forces.
He was fighting for a clean and non-corrupt political system.
In that struggle, he never spared anyone.
The Nation was his central message.
This is reflected in his writings, in the movies, plays and television serials he directed, in the movies for which he wrote the screenplay.
His satire made his criticism loveable even to those he criticized.
That is a not a cultivated or cultivable virtue.
It was the ears and eyes of millions of Tamil people.
Cho, through Thuglak, was the connecting bridge between masses and rulers.
I am glad that Thuglak will continue its journey in objective journalism as envisaged by Cho.
Those who have inherited the legacy of Thuglak have great responsibility on their shoulders.
To be guided by Cho’s vision and commitment will be a big challenge.
Adherence to this vision will be a great service to the people of Tamil Nadu.
I wish Mr. Gurumurthy and his team all the very best in this endeavour.
That Cho had mastered the art of satire, humour and irony need not be overstated.
I think we need more satire and humour.
Humour brings happiness in our lives.
Humour is the best healer.
The power of a smile or the power of laughter is more than the power of abuse or any other weapon.
Humour builds bridges instead of breaking them.
And this is exactly what we require today- building bridges.
Bridges between people.
Bridges between communities.
Bridges between societies.
Humour brings out human creativity.
We are living in an age where one speech or one event can create multiple memes, forwards.
I have participated in Thuglak’s annual readers’ meet before, in person in Chennai.
Since you have a tradition at this event to play verses from the Shrimad Bhagwad Gita in Mr. Cho’s voice, let me end with a Shlok in Mr. Cho’s honour:
Let us, together thank him for his contribution to the multiple fields he touched.
The Government would service the interest portion through the regular Plan assistance.

At present there are 45 lakh Self Help Groups with active participation of around five crore women all over rural India.
Prime Minister said that special attention is given to skill development of rural youth through Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana.
Training is given for employment as well as self-employment to meet the aspirations of youth for a better life.
During the interaction, Prime Minister talked about the importance of value addition and value chain approach.
He urged the Self Help Groups to register in the Government e-Market Place (GeM) to sell their produce.
Interacting with the Prime Minister, the members shared their experiences and success stories associated with Self Help Groups.
Prime Minister appreciated how poor women with their self-confidence and strength fought against all adversities.
Women beneficiaries also explained how Self Help Groups have ushered in a positive change in their lives.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has congratulated Saurabh Chaudhary on winning gold in Men’s 10m Air Pistol event at the 18th Asian Games 2018 in Jakarta – Palembang, Indonesia

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee on his birth anniversary today.
“On his Jayanti, I bow to Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee .
I am deeply honoured by the invitation to address this Joint Meeting of the U.S. Congress.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker for opening the doors of this magnificent Capitol.
In granting me this opportunity, you have honoured the world’s largest democracy and its 1.25 billion people.
As a representative of world’s largest democracy, it is indeed a privilege to speak to the leaders of its oldest.
Mr. Speaker,
I honoured their courage and sacrifice for the ideals of freedom and democracy.
That is why the threads of freedom and liberty form a strong bond between our two democracies.
Our nations may have been shaped by differing histories, cultures, and faiths.
Yet, our belief in democracy for our nations and liberty for our countrymen is common.
The idea that all citizens are created equal is a central pillar of the American constitution.
Modern India is in its 70th year.
For my government, the Constitution is its real holy book.
And, in that holy book, freedom of faith, speech and franchise, and equality of all citizens, regardless of background, are enshrined as fundamental rights.
800 million of my countrymen may exercise the freedom of franchise once every five years.
Engagement between our democracies has been visible in the manner in which our thinkers impacted one another, and shaped the course of our societies.
Gandhi’s non-violence inspired the heroism of Martin Luther King.
Today, a mere distance of 3 miles separates the Martin Luther King memorial at Tidal Basin from the statue of Gandhi at Massachusetts Avenue.
This proximity of their memorials in Washington mirrors the closeness of ideals and values they believed in.
The genius of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was nurtured in the years he spent at the Columbia University a century ago.
The impact of the U.S. constitution on him was reflected in his drafting of the Indian constitution some three decades later.
Our independence was ignited by the same idealism that fuelled your struggle for freedom.
No wonder then that former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee called India and the U.S. ‘natural allies’.
No wonder that the shared ideals and common philosophy of freedom shaped the bedrock of our ties.
No wonder then, that President Obama has called our ties the defining partnership of the 21st century.
More than fifteen years ago, Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee stood here and gave a call to step out of the ‘shadow of hesitation’ of the past.
The pages of our friendship since then tell a remarkable story.
And, in this exciting journey, the U.S. Congress has acted as its compass.
You helped us turn barriers into bridges of partnership.
In the fall of 2008, when the Congress passed the India-U.S. Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, it changed the very colours of leaves of our relationship.
We thank you for being there when the partnership needed you the most.
You have also stood by us in times of sorrow.
So, as you can see, we have many shared practices.
The genius of Norman Borlaug brought the Green Revolution and food security to India.
The embrace of our partnership extends to the entirety of human endeavour-from the depths of the oceans to the vastness of the space.
Our S&T collaboration continues to helps us in cracking the age-old problems in the fields of public health, education, food, and agriculture.
Ties of commerce and investment are flourishing.
We trade more with the U.S. than with any other nation.
Our cooperation also secures our cities and citizens from terrorists, and protects our critical infrastructure from cyber threats.
Civil Nuclear Cooperation, as I told President Obama yesterday, is a reality.
SIRI tells us that India’s ancient heritage of Yoga has over 30 million practitioners in the U.S..
It is estimated that more Americans bend for yoga than to throw a curve ball.
And, no Mr. Speaker, we have not yet claimed intellectual property right on Yoga.
Connecting our two nations is also a unique and dynamic bridge of three million Indian Americans.
They are your strength.
They are also the pride of India.
They symbolize the best of both our societies.
My understanding of your great country began long before I entered public office.
Long before assuming office, I travelled coast to coast, covering more than 25 States of America.
I realized then that the real strength of the U.S. was in the dreams of its people and the boldness of their ambitions.
And, do so by 2022, the seventy-fifth anniversary of India’s independence.
In every sector of India’s forward march, I see the U.S. as an indispensable partner.
Many of you also believe that a stronger and prosperous India is in America’s strategic interest.
Let us work together to convert shared ideals into practical cooperation.
There can be no doubt that in advancing this relationship, both nations stand to gain in great measure.
As the U.S. businesses search for new areas of economic growth, markets for their goods, a pool of skilled resources, and global locations to produce and manufacture, India could be their ideal partner.
The 21st century has brought with it great opportunities.
But, it also comes with its own set of challenges.
Inter-dependence is increasing.
But, while some parts of the world are islands of growing economic prosperity; other are mired in conflicts.
In Asia, the absence of an agreed security architecture creates uncertainty.
And, global institutions conceived in 20th century, seem unable to cope with new challenges or take on new responsibilities.
A strong India-U.S. partnership can anchor peace, prosperity and stability from Asia to Africa and from Indian Ocean to the Pacific.
It can also help ensure security of the sea lanes of commerce and freedom of navigation on seas.
But, the effectiveness of our cooperation would increase if international institutions framed with the mindset of the 20th century were to reflect the realities of today.
Afghans naturally recognize that the sacrifices of American have helped create a better life.
But, your contribution in keeping the region safe and secure is deeply appreciated even beyond.
India too has made an enormous contribution and sacrifices to support our friendship with Afghan people.
A commitment to rebuild a peaceful, and stable and prosperous Afghanistan our shared objective.
Yet, Distinguished Members, not just in Afghanistan, but elsewhere in South Asia, and globally, terrorism remains the biggest threat.
But, it’s philosophy is common: of hate, murder and violence.
Although it’s shadow is spreading across the world, it is incubated in India’s neighbourhood.
The fight against terrorism has to be fought at many levels.
And, the traditional tools of military, intelligence or diplomacy alone would not be able to win this fight.
We have both lost civilians and soldiers in combating it.
The need of the hour is for us to deepen our security cooperation.
And, base it on a policy:
Terrorism must be delegitimized.
The benefits of our partnership extend not just to the nations and regions that need it most.
We are also one of the largest contributors of troops to UN Peace Keeping Operations.
Often, India and the U.S. have combined their strengths in science, technology and innovation to help fight hunger, poverty, diseases and illiteracy in different parts of the world.
The success of our partnership is also opening up new opportunities for learning, security and development from Asia to Africa.
And, the protection of environment and caring for the planet is central to our shared vision of a just world.
For us in India, to live in harmony with mother earth is part of our ancient belief.
And, it also focuses on new ways to increase the availability and use of renewable energy.
This has also been the goal of our efforts in G-20, East Asia Summit and Climate Change summits.
Mr. Speaker and Distinguished Members
As we deepen our partnership, there would be times when we would have differing perspectives.
But, since our interests and concerns converge, the autonomy in decision making and diversity in our perspectives can only add value to our partnership.
So, as we embark on a new journey, and seek new goals, let us focus not just on matters routine but transformational ideas.
Ideas which can focus:
My final thoughts and words would reiterate that our relationship is primed for a momentous future.
In the lines of Walt Whitman,
“The Orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments, the baton has given the signal.”
Thank you Mr. Speaker and Distinguished members for this honour.
Thank you very much.
The CEO of Apple Inc., Mr. Tim Cook, called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today.

Mr. Cook shared Apple Inc.’s future plans for India.
He spoke of the possibilities of manufacturing and retailing in India.
He appreciated the breadth of young talent in India, and said the youth have significant skills which Apple would like to tap.
He sought support from Apple in furthering these objectives.
Issues regarding cyber-security and data encryption also came up for discussion.
The Prime Minister encouraged Mr. Cook to help the global community to cope with the challenges of cyber-crime.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has announced an ex- gratia of Rs. 2 lakh each for the next of kin of those who have lost their lives in the floods in Assam and Rajasthan.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi congratulated Bharat Ratna Awardees.
PM praised Nanaji Deshmukh for his contribution to the society and said “Nanaji Deshmukh’s stellar contribution towards rural development showed the way for a new paradigm of empowering those living in our villages.
He personifies humility, compassion and service to the downtrodden.
He is a Bharat Ratna in the truest sense.”
“The songs and music of Bhupen Hazarika are admired by people across generations.
From them radiates the message of Justice, harmony and brotherhood.
He popularized India’s music traditions globally.
Happy that the Bharat Ratna has been conferred on Bhupen Da.” the Prime Minister said.
While speaking on Shri Pranab Mukherjee he said, “Pranab Da is an outstanding statesman of our times.
His wisdom and intellect have few parallels.
“I am delighted to join the programme to mark the conclusion of the Narmada Seva Yatra in Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh, tomorrow afternoon.
Narmada Seva Yatra is an excellent mass movement to protect the Narmada and conveys a larger message of saving the environment as well.
Tomorrow in Madhya Pradesh, I will be launching the Narmada Seva Mission, which will surely have a major impact on MP’s ecology.
In a series of tweets, the Prime Minister also said that it is heartening to see such warmth, enthusiasm and patience of the citizens to bear this limited inconvenience for a greater good.
He assured that the Government is unwavering in its effort to create an India which is corruption free and in ensuring that the fruits of development touch every citizen.
“So happy to learn that citizens are expressing their gratitude to bankers & getting notes exchanged in a very patient and orderly manner.
It is also heartening to learn that people are actively volunteering to help senior citizens withdraw money and exchange their currency.
Such warmth, enthusiasm and the patience to bear limited inconvenience for a greater good is indeed very heartening.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has paid tributes to Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee on his birth anniversary.
“On his birth anniversary, my tributes to Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee.
President Hollande, President Obama, Excellencies, Mr. Bill Gates, Distinguished Guests,
The outstanding arrangements reflect the character of this great Nation.
The world has assembled in Paris to change the course of our planet to a sustainable path.
We must speak about goals and targets on carbon emissions and rise in global temperature.
But, it is just as important to focus on the instruments that will make it natural and easy for the world to get there.
A vast section of humanity lives at the edge of poverty and in darkness after the sun sets.
They need energy to light up their homes and power their future.
And, they are also the most vulnerable to the consequences of an industrial age powered by fossil fuel.
Access to energy and a better life is a universal aspiration.
And, so are clean environment and healthy habitats.
The advanced countries must leave enough room for developing countries to grow.
And, we must strive for a lighter carbon footprint on our growth path.
For that we must come together in a partnership to bring clean energy within the reach of all.
Innovation is vital for combating climate change and ensuring climate justice.
That is what makes this Innovation Summit very special.
This unites us behind a common purpose.
We can make conventional energy cleaner.
And, we can develop newer sources of renewable energy.
This is a global responsibility to our collective future.
We should have an international network of 30-40 universities and labs focusing for next ten years on renewable energy.
Innovation must be backed by means to make it affordable and ensure adoption.
We have a very successful models of public-private partnership with many countries present here.
India is also building renewable capacity in developing countries, including small island states.
The progress on clean energy technology and costs is impressive.
We will also lay the foundation of a new economy in new low carbon age.
We will restore the balance between ecology and economy, and between our inheritance and obligation to the future.

The GST Council, in its meeting held in August 2017, taking into consideration the fact that post introduction of GST, the total incidence on motor vehicles [GST+ Compensation Cess] has come down vis-a-vis pre-GST total tax, incidence, and had recommended increase in the maximum rate at which Compensation Cess can be levied on motor vehicles falling under headings 8702 and 8703 from 15% to 25%.
“I bow to the great Savitribai Phule on her Jayanti.
Hers was a life devoted to the empowerment of the poor and marginalised.
She gave utmost importance to education and social reform.
Distinguished dignitaries on the dais,
Apart from the Sendai Framework, the international community adopted two other major frameworks to shape the future of humanity:
– the Sustainable Development Goals,
– and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
The spirit of inter-connectedness, highlighted in the film, is the hallmark of these global frameworks.
The success of each one of these depends on the success of the other two.
Disaster Risk Reduction has a pivotal role in supporting adaptation to climate change as well as sustainable development.
It is in this context that this conference becomes timely and relevant.
Over the last two decades, the world, and especially our region has undergone many changes – most of them positive.
The Asia-Pacific region has been a global leader in more ways than one.
Over the last twenty years, more than eight hundred and fifty thousand people died from disasters in the Asia-Pacific.
Seven of the top ten countries in the world in terms of number of deaths due to disasters are in the Asia-Pacific.
I have seen for myself the human suffering caused by disasters.
I witnessed the Gujarat earthquake of 2001, and later, as Chief Minister of the State, I worked with my people to support post-earthquake recovery.
It was distressing to see the suffering of the affected people.
But I was also inspired by their courage, ingenuity and resolve to recover from the disaster.
In my experience, the more we relied on people’s own leadership, the better were the outcomes.
This was not limited only to owner driven reconstruction of houses, but also to construction of community buildings.
We need to support such initiative and leadership through policies and practices.
We in Asia have learnt from disasters.
After the Indian Ocean Tsunami of 2004, the five worst affected countries brought in new laws for disaster risk management.
In a couple of days, we will observe the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
This would be an occasion to celebrate the huge improvements we have made in tsunami early warning.
In December 2004, the Indian Ocean Tsunami caught us unprepared, and there was no warning.
We now have a fully functional Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System.
Along with its Australian and Indonesian counterparts, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services is mandated to issue regional tsunami bulletins.
The same goes for improvements in cyclone early warning.
In India, if we compare the impact of cyclone events in 1999 and 2013, we can see the progress we have made.
Similar progress has been made in many countries.
For example, after the 1991 cyclone, the Government of Bangladesh launched a large community-based cyclone preparedness programme.
It led to a significant reduction in loss of lives from cyclones.
It is now recognized as a global best practice.
This is just the beginning.
There are daunting challenges ahead.
The Asia-Pacific is rapidly urbanizing.
Perhaps within a decade more people in the region will live in cities than in villages.
If we do not manage this growth, in terms of both planning and execution, the risk of economic and human losses from disasters will be higher than ever before.
In this context, let me outline a ten-point agenda for renewing our efforts towards disaster risk reduction:
First, all development sectors must imbibe the principles of disaster risk management.
Over the next couple of decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will come up in our region.
We need to ensure that we build it to best available standards of disaster safety.
This is a smart strategy, which pays off in the long term.
All our public expenditure must take into account risk considerations.
In India, the ‘housing for all’ programme and ‘smart cities’ initiative represent such opportunities.
India will work with other partner countries and stakeholders to build a coalition or centre for promoting disaster resilient infrastructure in the region.
This will help generate new knowledge for hazard risk assessment, disaster resilient technologies and mechanisms for integrating risk reduction in infrastructure financing.
Second, work towards risk coverage for all – starting from poor households to small and medium enterprises to multi-national corporations to nation states.
Currently, in most countries of the region, penetration of insurance is limited to only middle and upper-middle income groups.
We need to think big and also think innovatively.
The Jan Dhan Yojana has brought millions of people into the banking system.
The Suraksha Bima Yojana provides risk insurance to millions who need it the most.
We have launched the Fasal Bima Yojana, which will provide risk cover to millions of farmers.
These are the basic building blocks of resilience at the household level.
They also have unique strengths and insights.
We must train a large number of women volunteers to support special needs of women affected by disasters.
Fourth, invest in risk mapping globally.
For mapping risks related to hazards such as earthquakes we have widely accepted standards and parameters.
Based on these, in India, we have mapped seismic zones, with five as highest seismic risk and two as low risk.
For disaster risk related to other hazards such as chemical hazards, forest fires, cyclones, different types of floods, we need to evolve similar globally accepted risk categories.
This will help us ensure that we have a common understanding of the nature and severity of disaster risks in different parts of the world.
As part of this network, different universities could specialize in multi-disciplinary research on disaster issues most relevant to them.
Universities located in coastal areas could specialize in managing risks from coastal hazards, and the ones located in the hill cities could focus on mountain hazards.
Seventh, utilize the opportunities provided by social media and mobile technologies.
Social media is transforming disaster response.
It is helping response agencies in quickly organizing themselves, and enabling citizens to connect more easily with authorities.
In disaster after disaster, affected people are using social media to help each other.
We must recognize the potential of social media and develop applications for all aspects of disaster risk management.
Eighth, build on local capacity and initiative.
The task of disaster risk management, particularly in rapidly growing economies, is so huge that formal institutions of the state can at best be instrumental in creating the enabling conditions.
Specific actions have to be designed and implemented locally.
Over the last two decades, most community based efforts have been confined to disaster preparedness and contingency planning for the short term.
Such efforts reduce risk and create opportunities for local development and sustainable livelihoods.
Localization of disaster risk reduction will also ensure that we make the most of traditional best practices and indigenous knowledge.
Response agencies need to interact with their communities, and make them familiar with the essential drill of disaster response.
For example, if a local fire service visits one school in its area every week, it would sensitize thousands of children over a period of one year.
Often the same mistakes are repeated.
We need a more vibrant and visual system of learning.
The United Nations could start an international competition of documentary films that record disaster events, their scale, and relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery afterwards.
Post-disaster recovery is an opportunity to not just ‘build back better’ in terms of physical infrastructure, but also in terms of improved institutional systems for managing risk.
For this we need to put in place systems that can quickly provide risk assessments.
India will work with partner countries and multilateral development agencies to establish a facility for technical support to post-disaster reconstruction of houses.
And finally, bring about greater cohesion in international response to disasters.
In the aftermath of a disaster, disaster responders pour in from all over the world.
This collective strength and solidarity could be enhanced further if we work under a common umbrella.
The United Nations could think of a common logo and branding under which all those who are helping with relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction operate.
Armed Forces protect nation states against external security threats.
But to deal with disasters, we need to equip society with the right education.
In our effort to build disaster resilience, we stand shoulder to shoulder with all the nations of the region.
Regional and International Cooperation has an important role in providing an added push to our efforts.
Last year in November, India organized the first-ever South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
In the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
India is ready to make its space capabilities available to any country for purposes of disaster risk management.
As we implement the Sendai Framework, we would welcome new opportunities for regional and international collaboration.
The main areas of cooperation are:
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its ex-post facto approval to provide an additional 50 days of unskilled manual work in the financial year over and above the 100 days assured to job card holders, in such rural areas where drought or natural calamities have been notified.
This will enable States to provide additional wage employment to the rural poor in drought affected areas.
The poorest rural households will benefit from this, as it will help in immediate absorption of rural seasonal unemployment, and reduce rural distress.
To provide immediate relief to farmers, in view of the deficit monsoon during Kharif 2015, the Government of India has already taken a number of decisions.
Orders on these measures have already been issued to all State Governments, which will implement them on the basis of assessed need.
The various decisions are:-
1. Diesel Subsidy Scheme for farmers in affected areas: It has been decided to provide diesel subsidy to farmers to enable them to provide life saving irrigation through diesel pump sets in drought and deficit rainfall areas to protect standing crops (allocation of Rs.100 crore).
It is proposed to provide 50 percent subsidy on the cost of diesel (Rs 2000 per hectare) to affected farmers, limited to a maximum of two hectares per farmer.
The cost of assistance provided shall be shared between the Government of India and the State Government/UT Administration concerned on 50:50 basis.
The enhancement is valid till 31.12.2015.
3. Interventions for saving perennial horticulture crops: Appropriate input support measures will be provided to rejuvenate water stressed horticulture crops, with an additional allocation of Rs.150 crore.
The scheme is to be implemented in all drought affected districts / blocks in the country which are covered under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), being implemented by Dept. of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare.
Farmers in drought affected districts/ blocks will be provided assistance at the rate of Rs.3200/- per hectare as per cost norms for a maximum area of two ha per beneficiary for taking up additional production of fodder in these districts/blocks.
8. Availability of seeds and other inputs for Kharif, 2015: Availability of seeds and other inputs is being monitored / reviewed on a continuous basis in the weekly Crop Weather Watch Group (CWWG) meetings being held in the Department of Agriculture.
Weekly video conference with States is also being held to get first-hand information about State’s preparedness and to advise States appropriately whenever needed.
9. SMS Advisory: The Ministry, through the m-kisan portal sends SMS advisories to registered farmers.
These advisories include weather based SMS advisories, advisories to suggest measures to minimize adverse impact of extreme weather event.
11. SDRF/NDRF funds: First Instalment of SDRF released: The State Government is primarily responsible for providing necessary relief in the wake of natural calamities.
Government of India supplements the efforts of state Governments with financial assistance.
For undertaking relief measures, funds are available with State Governments in the form of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).
Additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for natural calamities of severe nature and is approved on the basis of Memorandum received from the State Government in accordance with established procedure, keeping in view items and norms in vogue for assistance.
The first instalment of SDRF has already been released to State Governments.

Mr Scheer shared his perspective on further developing friendly relations between the two countries.
The Prime Minister expressed concern over the problems faced by farmers due to abnormal weather over the past year.
He said that helping the farmer in this time of distress is our responsibility, and therefore, the Government had sent teams of Central Ministers to affected areas, to assess the extent of damage.
He said the Union and State Governments, the banks and insurance companies would all do their utmost to provide relief to the farmers.
In another major announcement, the Prime Minister said that the input subsidy given to distressed farmers will be enhanced by 50 percent of the existing amounts.
The announcements were made by the Prime Minister in his address during the launch of the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana.
From the street vendors to shopping malls and from Craftsmen to hotels-restaurant-linked businesses, across the Gujarat, have come here to showcase and promote their products.
Now vibrant Gujarat as well as the start of Ahmedabad shopping Festival, is a commendable initiative”.
The PM added, “The Government is constantly working to create a conducive environment for business in the country.
In the past 4 years, old laws have been abolished and hundreds of rules are made easier.
It is because of such efforts that we have improved significantly on the Ease of Doing Business rankings from 142 to 77”.
The PM added,“It is our constant endeavour to simplify procedures for small entrepreneurs.
We are moving towards the system when the banks can give credit to small entrepreneurs on the basis of GST and other returns.
We are clearing loans up to Rs one crore in 59 minutes”.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has spoken to Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Shri Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and took stock of the situation arising due to the earthquake.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has lauded the passage of the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Bill, 2019 in the Rajya Sabha.
“Delighted the Rajya Sabha has passed the Constitution (One Hundred And Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Bill, 2019.
Glad to see such widespread support for the Bill.
The House also witnessed a vibrant debate, where several members expressed their insightful opinions.
The Prime Minister welcomed the intensive exchange of high level visits between India and China over the last two years, and said that such visits contribute to building strategic understanding between the two countries.
The Prime Minister fondly recalled his successful bilateral visit to China in May 2015, as well as his visit to Hangzhou in September 2016 to attend the G-20 Summit.
The two leaders discussed issues of mutual interest, including bilateral counter-terrorism cooperation.
I thanked all the parties on that day.
When all parties work together in the larger nation interest, positive outcomes and results emerge.
We will talk about the issues pertaining to the needs and the aspirations of the people.
Besides, the government’s thinking would also be reflected.
I expect a good, healthy debate with excellent contribution from all the political parties..
From the Government side, we will strive our level best to accomplish the transaction of business carrying all the political parties together.
In order to carry forward the work on GST, we have held discussions with the state Government and the political parties.
The consultation process has been going on ahead of this session as well.
I am happy to be a part of this august gathering of global leaders and decision makers of the food processing sector.
I welcome you all to World Food India 2017.
This event will provide you a glimpse of the opportunities that await you, in India.
It will showcase our potential in the food processing value chain.
It will provide a platform to connect with various stakeholders, and collaborate for mutual prosperity.
And, it will present to you, some of our most delightful cuisine, which has stimulated taste buds across the world.
India’s strengths in agriculture, are many and diverse.
We are second, globally, in terms of production of rice, wheat, fish, fruits and vegetables.
India is also the world’s biggest milk producer.
Our horticulture sector has shown an average growth rate of 5.5 per cent annually over the last ten years.
Our trade synergies with Europe and South East Asia through the Spice Route are well known.
Even Christopher Columbus was attracted to Indian spices, and reached America, as he searched for an alternate sea route to India.
Food processing is a way of life in India.
It has been practiced for ages, even in the humblest of households.
Simple, home-based techniques, such as fermentation, have resulted in the creation of our famous pickles, papads, chutneys and murabbas that now excite both the elite and the masses, across the world.
Let us turn, for a while, to the big picture.
India is today one of the fastest growing economies of the world.
The Goods and Services Tax, or GST, has eliminated the multiplicity of taxes.
India was ranked number one in the world in 2016 in greenfield investment.
India is also rapidly progressing on the Global Innovation Index, Global Logistics Index and Global Competitiveness Index.
Starting a new business in India is now easier than ever before.
Procedures for obtaining clearances from various agencies have been simplified.
Archaic laws have been repealed, and the burden of compliances has been reduced.
I now turn specifically, to food processing.
The Government has undertaken a range of transformational initiatives.
India is now the most preferred investment destination in this sector.
A single-window facilitation cell provides handholding for foreign investors.
There are attractive fiscal incentives from the Union and State Governments.
It maps resources upto the local level, with processing requirements.
It is also a platform for business networking, for farmers, processors, traders, and logistics operators.
Private sector participation has been increasing in many segments of the value chain.
However, more investment is required in contract farming, raw material sourcing and creating agri linkages.
Many international companies in India have taken a lead in contract farming initiatives.
This is a clear opportunity for global super-market chains considering India as a major outsourcing hub.
On one hand, there are opportunities in post-harvest management, like primary processing and storage, preservation infrastructure, cold chain, and refrigerated transportation.
On the other hand, there is immense potential for food processing and value addition, especially in niche areas such as organic and fortified foods.
Increasing urbanization, and a growing middle class, are resulting in an ever-growing demand for wholesome, processed food.
Let me share just one statistic.
Over a million passengers have a meal on a train in India, every single day.
Each one of them, is a potential customer for the food processing industry.
Such is the scale of opportunity that is waiting to be tapped.
Lifestyle disease is raising consciousness globally, about the nature and quality of food consumption.
There is a growing aversion to the use of artificial colours, chemicals and preservatives.
The perfect blend of hygienic, nutritious and tasty processed food, with the added benefits of preventive healthcare, can be produced economically, here in India.
The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has been engaged in ensuring that processed food made in India, matches global quality standards.
The harmonization of the food additives standards with Codex, and the building of robust testing and laboratory infrastructure, will go a long way in creating an enabling environment for food businesses.
We have a stated target of doubling farm incomes within five years.
Recently, we launched a national level programme, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana, to create world-class food processing infrastructure.
Through these food parks, we aim to link agro-processing clusters with key production centres.
This will offer immense value proposition in crops such as potato, pineapple, oranges and apples.
Nine such parks are already operational, and more than thirty others are in the process of coming up across the country.
To improve last mile delivery, we are improving governance, by increasing access to digital technology.
Each sub sector of the food industry in India offers immense opportunity.
Let me give you some illustrations.
The dairy sector has emerged as a vital area for the rural economy.
We now aim to take this to the next level by increasing production levels of multiple products based on milk.
Honey is nature’s gift to mankind.
Currently, we rank sixth in the production and export of honey.
India is now ripe, for a sweet revolution.
India contributes over six per cent of global fish production.
We are the world’s second largest exporter of shrimps.
India exports fish and fisheries products to about 95 countries.
We aim to make a big leap in the ocean economy through the blue revolution.
Sikkim, in north-eastern India, has become India’s first fully organic state.
The entire north-east offers opportunities to create functional infrastructure for organic produce.
In order to be successful in Indian markets, understanding Indian food habits and tastes is a key requirement.
To give you just one example, milk based products and fruit-juice based drinks are an intrinsic part of Indian food habits.
That is why, I have been suggesting to manufacturers of aerated drinks, the potential of blending five per cent fruit juice in their products.
Food processing also holds solutions to nutrition security.
For example, our coarse grains and millets have high nutritional value.
They can also withstand adverse agro-climatic conditions.
They can be called “nutrition rich and climate smart” crops.
Can we take up a venture based on these?
This will raise incomes of some of the poorest of our farmers, and also enhance our nutrition levels.
Such products, shall, of course, find resonance across the world.
Can we link our potential, to the world’s requirements?
Can we link Indian traditions with the future of mankind?
Can we connect India’s farmers with markets around the world?
These are some questions that I wish to leave you with.
I am confident that World Food India will help us take some concrete steps in this direction.
The place with unlimited opportunity from farm to fork.
The place to produce, process, and prosper.
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi launched various development projects worth Rs.1000 crores in Daman & Diu today.
He distributed certificates to beneficiaries of programs and addressed a public meeting at the Daman college ground.
The Prime Minister described the public meeting in Daman as a historic event not only in terms of the number of people who have joined him but also in terms of the development projects being launched from there.
He congratulated the people and local administration for making Daman Open Defecation Free.
He said that the manner in which Daman has taken to cleanliness as a mass movement using e-rickshaws and CNG is a shining example for all of us.
The Prime Minister said that the Government is taking several steps for the welfare of fishermen and his entire emphasis is on the ‘blue revolution’ inspired by the commitment to bring a positive difference in the lives of fishermen.
The Prime Minister inaugurated Air Odisha’s flight connecting Ahmedabad with Diu under the UDAN scheme.
He flagged off Pawan Hans helicopter services from Daman to Diu through a video link.
The Prime Minister presented Badhai kit to the newly born girl child under Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao yojana.
He handed over certificates to women given free driving training by Daman and Diu administration and cycle to school going girls.
The Prime Minister distributed permits for CNG driven vehicles.
My young friend Deepak Lather wins a Bronze in the Men’s 69 kg category.
The move will be helpful in bringing uniformity in Judicial Service.
After the departure of PATJHAD, when old and withered leaves fall, new leaves begin to sprout on the trees.
Gardens and orchards sport a verdant green.
The melodious chirping of birds warms the cockles of our hearts.
Not just flowers, fruits too appear to be shining bathed in the sun rays on tree branches.
The flower heads of the summer fruit mango manifest themselves in the spring season itself.
At the same time bright yellow flowers of mustard swaying in their fields kindle hope in the hearts of the farmers.
Blossoming of bright red Jungle Flame flowers, better known as Tesu or Palash heralds the advent of Holi.
Amir Khusro has portrayed these moments of change of season in a very interesting manner.
Amir Khusro has written:
When nature is at her joyous best, when the season is enchanting, we human beings too enjoy this to the fullest.
The festivals of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi, impart hues of happiness to a person’s life.
In an ambience of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are about to bid adieu to the last month of Phalgun and are eagerly awaiting to welcome the arrival of the new month of Chaitra.
At the outset, I express my gratitude to lakhs of citizens of our country for sending in a multitude of suggestions when I ask for them before ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
Shobha Jalan has written to me on the NarendraModiApp that many in the public are not aware of the achievements of ISRO.
And therefore she wants me to provide some information on the recent launch of 104 satellites and the Interceptor Missile.
Shobha Ji, thank you very much for paying attention to this shining example of India’s pride.
Whether it is eradicating poverty, preventing diseases, connecting with the world, or disseminating knowledge and information, technology and science have made a mark for themselves.
15th February, 2017 is a day of immense pride for India.
Our scientists have brought laurels to the nation, witnessed by the whole world.
And we know that over the last few years, ISRO has accomplished various unprecedented missions with flying colours.
After the successful mission of sending Mangalyaan to planet Mars, recently ISRO scripted a world record in the arena of space.
India has created history by becoming the first country to launch successfully 104 satellites into space at one go.
And what is further heartening is the fact that this was PSLV’s 38th successive successful launch.
This is a historic achievement for not just ISRO but for all of India.
This cost effective, efficient space programme of ISRO has become a marvel for the entire world; the world has admired this success of Indian scientists of India whole-heartedly.
This tremendous participation of youth and women is a major glorious dimension in ISRO’s success.
On behalf of our countrymen, I heartily congratulate the scientists at ISRO.
Adhering consistently to the objective of bringing Space Science to the common man, for the service of the nation, they are creating one record after another.
One runs short of words in complimenting and congratulating our scientists, their entire team.
Shobha Ji has asked one more question and that pertains to the security of India.
It is about India having acquired a great capability.
This important matter has not been discussed much, but it has drawn Shobha Ji’s attention.
In the field of defence also, India has successfully test fired the Ballistic Interceptor Missile.
During its trial, this missile, based on interceptor technology, destroyed an enemy missile at an altitude of about 100 km above the surface of the earth and thus marked its success.
This is a significant, cutting edge competency in the arena of security.
And you will be happy to know that hardly four or five countries in the world possess this capability.
India’s scientists have demonstrated this prowess.
Its core strength lies in the fact that if, even from a distance of 2000 km, a missile is launched to attack India, our missile can pre-emptively destroy it in the space itself.
When we witness new technology, or a new scientific feat, we are left overwhelmed with joy.
Inquisitiveness has played a significant role in the journey of progression of human life and development.
And those gifted with extra-ordinary intelligence do not let inquisitiveness to remain just that; they begin further questioning it, look around for newer queries, and try to create new realms in the spirit of enquiry.
This incessant spirit of enquiry leads to new inventions.
They do not rest till they obtain an answer.
If we try to take a bird’s eye view of thousands of years of the onward march of human life and progress, we can easily say that this great journey has no point of culmination.
Attempting to know the universe, the laws of Nature, the inner recesses of the human mind is an unending process.
This is what begets new Science, new technology.
And every technology, every new form of Science gives birth to a new era.
My dear young friends, while we refer to Science and the sheer perseverance of scientists, I have many a time said in ‘Mann Ki Baat’, that the attraction of Science for our young generation should increase.
The country needs more and more scientists.
Today’s scientist becomes a potent catalyst for enduring change in the lives of our future generations.
To give you an example, I came across an innovation for our poor fishermen brethren.
It is a simple mobile App.
But it is so powerful that when a fisherman goes to sea for fishing, this App is able to provide guidance for direction to locate the most productive fishing zones and also provide multifarious types of information such as the direction and speed of the wind, the height of waves and so on.
This whole array of information is available on this mobile App which can be utilised by our fishermen brethren for moving to those areas with maximum fish presence in a very short time and thus earning their livelihood.
There are times when a problem portrays the importance of Science for finding its solution.
In that situation, two persons worked in right earnest and developed a dwelling structure that saves the house and its occupants, mitigates the water-logging and can prevent water borne diseases also.
There were a large number of such innovations.
What I’m trying to infer is that in society, in the country, there are many who take on such roles.
And our society is also increasingly turning out to be technology driven.
Systems are getting technology driven.
In a way, technology is becoming an inseparable part of our lives.
In the recent days, one can see a lot of emphasis being laid on Digi-Dhan.
Gradually, people are shedding their hard currency mindset and moving towards digital currency.
Digital transactions in India are witnessing a very rapid surge.
The young generation, in particular, is getting habituated to digital payments through its mobile handsets.
I believe this to be a good portent.
In recent times, Lucky Graahak Yojana and Digi-Dhan Vyapari Yojana have received overwhelming support.
For about two months now, everyday fifteen thousand people have been winning a prize of a thousand rupees each.
And through these two schemes, the process to make digital payment a mass movement has been initiated; it has received a rousing welcome in the entire country.
It is a delight to learn that till now, under the Digi-Dhan Yojana, ten lakh people have been rewarded, over fifty thousand traders have won prizes and an amount of almost over a hundred & fifty crores rupees has been earned as prize money by people who have promoted and carried forward this great campaign.
Under this scheme, there are more than a hundred customers who have received prizes of one lakh rupees each.
But I feel I must share with you what he has written most prominently.
He says that when he received this reward, it struck him that a poor old woman had lost all her belongings because of a fire that broke out in her house.
He felt she had more a rightful claim on the reward he had got and gave away the thousand rupees to her.
You have done something that is exemplary and inspiring.
A 22-year old cab driver brother Sabir from Delhi adopted the digital mode in his transactions after demonetisation and went on to win a prize of one lakh rupees under the ‘Lucky Grahak Yojana’ of the Government.
Though he continues to be a driver, in a way, he has now become an ambassador for this scheme.
One young post-graduate student Pooja Nemade from Maharashtra keeps sharing her experience with friends about how her family members are using RuPay Card and e-wallet facilities and deriving enjoyment out of it and also as to how important the prize of rupees one lakh is for her.
She has taken up this in a mission mode and is bringing others into its fold.
Take it further as it has a very major and prominent role in the fight against corruption and black money.
To me, each and every individual involved in this mission constitute a new anti-corruption cadre in the country.
In a way you are a soldier in the cause of cleanliness and purity.
There is going to be a very big draw of prizes worth crores of rupees on 14th April.
We have recently celebrated 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Remembering him, you teach at least 125 persons about downloading the BHIM App.
Give special importance to Baba Saheb Ambedkar’s birth anniversary this time and the BHIM App.
For this, I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation laid by Dr. Baba Saheb.
We have to go from door to door associating everybody in order to place the BHIM App in 125 crore hands.
Since its beginning about two-three months ago, this movement has had a clear impact and has been a very big success in many townships, villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture makes a very major contribution to the fundamentals of our country’s economy.
Economic prowess of villages imparts momentum to the nation’s economic progress.
I wish to share a very happy news with you today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have toiled hard to fill our granaries.
The hard work of the farmers has resulted in a record production of food grains.
All signals indicate that our farmers have broken all previous records.
There has been such bountiful crop this time in the fields of our farmers that every day has appeared to be a celebration of Pongal and Baisakhi.
More than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country this year.
This is 8 percent more than the last record set up by our farmers.
Thus, it is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I want to specially thank the farmers of the country.
This is not merely the production of pulses but a yeoman service rendered by the farmers to the poor of my country.
My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special gratitude for the way they whole-heartedly accepted my request, my prayer and put in their hard labour to get a record production of pulses.
My dear countrymen, the government, society, institutions, organizations, in fact everyone, is making some or the other effort towards greater cleanliness.
In a way, everyone is seen working towards the cause of cleanliness in a conscious manner.
The government is continuously making efforts in this regard.
Recently, an event was organised in Telengana under the leadership of the Secretary of our Ministry of Water and Sanitation of the Government of India, in which senior officers from 23 state governments participated.
And, this was not confined to having just a closed door seminar, but the importance of cleanliness was practically demonstrated at Warangal in Telangana.
Toilet pit emptying exercise was carried out in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February.
Toilet pits in six houses were emptied and cleaned and the officers personally demonstrated that the used up pits of twin pit toilet can be emptied and then re-used.
They also displayed as to how convenient these new technique toilets are and there is absolutely no inconvenience or hesitation in emptying or cleaning these toilets and even the psychological barrier does not come in the way at all.
And, we can ourselves clean these toilet pits just as we do other general cleaning.
And, this exercise showed results, media in the country gave it wide publicity and highlighted its importance.
And it is quite natural also because when people see an IAS officer cleaning a toilet pit himself, the fact is naturally noticed by the country.
And we consider the waste taken out from a toilet pit as sheer useless garbage but if considered from the angle of its use as a fertiliser, this, in a way, is black gold.
For a family of six members, the model of one standard Twin Pit Toilet gets filled in about five years.
After that the waste can easily be redirected to the other pit.
This waste deposited in the pit gets completely decomposed in six to twelve months time.
This decomposed waste can be safely handled quite conveniently and can be used as ‘NPK’ which is a very useful fertilizer.
Our farmers know ‘NPK’ very well.
Others must also have experimented with initiatives similar to those undertaken by the Government.
Now Doordarshan is broadcasting a special programme of ‘Swachchhta Samachar’, that is ‘Cleanliness News’.
Highlighting such things in this programme will be very beneficial.
Various government departments regularly observe Cleanliness Fortnight.
During the first fortnight of March, Women and Child Development Ministry along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs will be laying stress on the Cleanliness Campaign.
And two other ministries, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will take the Cleanliness Campaign forward during the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever an Indian achieves something notable, the whole country feels a new energy and the self-confidence gets a boost.
We all hailed the commendable performance by our Divyang Players at Rio Paralympics.
India defeated Pakistan in the final of the Blind T-20 World Cup held earlier this month to become World Champions for the second consecutive time and thus raised our national prestige to a new height.
I once again congratulate all players of our team.
The country is really proud of these Divyang friends for their achievement.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, strongly determined, courageous and possess tremendous resolve.
We get to learn something each moment from them.
Be it the field of sports or space science, the women of our country lag behind none.
They are moving ahead shoulder to shoulder and are bringing glory to the nation with their commendable achievements.
Our women players won a silver medal at the Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy recently.
My heartiest congratulations to all these players.
The whole world celebrates 8th March as Women’s Day.
In India also more importance needs to be given to our daughters along with increased awareness and sensitivity towards them.
‘Beti Bachao – Beti Padhao’ movement is moving forward with rapid strides.
It gives us great joy and happiness when we hear the news of festive celebration on the birth of a daughter.
In a way, a positive mindset towards our daughters is leading towards societal acceptance.
I have heard that in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, child marriage has been banned under a special campaign.
About 175 child marriages have been prevented so far.
The district administration has opened bank accounts of over 55-60 thousand daughters under ‘Sukanya Samridhi Yojana’.
As we get ready to celebrate ‘Women’s Day’ this 8th March, there is only one sentiment: –
My dear countrymen, all of you get an opportunity to express your views from time to time in ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
You also connect actively with this programme.
I get to know so many things from you.
I get to know as to what all is happening on the ground, in our villages and in the hearts and minds of the poor.
I am very grateful to you for your contribution.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the loss of lives due to cyclone in Tamil Nadu.
The Prime Minister said, “My thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives due to cyclonic conditions in parts of Tamil Nadu.
I pray for the quick recovery of those injured.
Officials are working towards providing all possible assistance in the wake of the cyclone.
Spoke to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Thiru Edappadi K. Palaniswami regarding the situation arising due to cyclone conditions in the state.
Assured all possible help from the Centre.
“Deeply saddened by the bus accident in Bihar’s Madhubani district.
Prime Minister appreciated the proactive role being played by the Indian diaspora in Suriname not only in the development of that country but also in strengthening historical ties between the two countries.
15 Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) declared as Institutes of National Importance
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved –
i. Introduction of the Indian Institutes of Information Technology Public Private Partnership (IIIT PPP) Bill, 2017;
ii. To grant statutory status to the fifteen Indian Institutes of Information Technology in Public Private Partnership and declare them as Institutions of National Importance;
iii. To enable these institutions to grant degrees to their students in the academic courses conducted by them.
Terming, drugs as a great menace to society, Prime Minister said that as per WHO estimates, over three crore people around the world are suffering from drug addiction.
It is a big misconception that drugs are a style statement”, PM said.
The Prime Minster said, “We have passed a historic bill to provide 10% reservation to Economically Weaker Sections of the General Category in Lok Sabha yesterday.
This has strengthened our resolve of Sab Ka Saath Sabka Vikas”
On the Citizenship Amendment Bill, the Prime Minister assured the people of Assam and North East that their rights and opportunities will be protected.
He said, “the bill has cleared the decks for grant of Indian citizenship to the sons and daughters of Mother India residing in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.
After seeing the ups and downs of history, these brothers and sisters of ours want to be a part and parcel of India.”
The Prime Minister was addressing a public rally at Indira Gandhi Stadium in Solapur after launching and laying down foundation stones of several development projects for the region.
Prime Minister laid the foundation Stone of 30,000 houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.
He said,”Today, we have inaugurated a project of 30000 homes meant for the family of poor, labourers.
The beneficiaries of this project are those who work in factories, pull rickshaws, drive auto, etc.
I ensure you that very soon you will have the keys of your home in your hands.”
The Prime Minister added that efforts have been made to make housing affordable for the middle class families.
Now they can save up to Rs. 6 lakhs on home loans over a period of 20 years which is a reflection of the measures undertaken by the Government for Ease of Living.
He added that efforts are on to start flights from Solapur under the Regional Air connectivity scheme- Udan Yojana.
As a part of his vision of Swachh Bharat and Swastha Bharat, the Prime Minister dedicated to the nation Underground Sewerage System, and three Sewage Treatment Plants in Solapur.
This will increase the sewer coverage of the town and improve sanitation in the city.
It will bring significant improvement in service delivery and improve public health enabled by technology as a means to create smart outcomes for citizens.
I am very happy to address you at this charity dinner at the International Diamond Conference.
This conference is part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council of India.
The conference on the theme of “Mines to Market 2017”, brings together miners, diamond companies, experts, retailers, bankers and analysts from across the globe.
Since the council was created fifty years ago, India has made rapid strides in this industry.
As you all know, India is now the world’s largest manufacturer of cut and polished diamonds.
The gems and jewellery sector is one of the leading sectors in India in terms of value of exports as well as employment generation.
In the last four decades, India has emerged as the leader in diamond manufacturing and export.
Friends, till recently Indian importers had to go abroad to view and purchase rough diamonds.
In December, 2014 at the World Diamond Conference held in Delhi, I had announced in the presence of the Russian President that we would set up a Special Notified Zone to achieve this.
This promise has been kept.
Amendments have been made to our laws to enable rough diamonds to enter and exit, duty free for the purpose of viewing.
The Special Notified Zone at the Bharat Diamond Bourse became operational in November, 2015.
This has already shown good results.
Earlier only eighty to ninety big merchants used to get access to global rough diamonds by travelling to Belgium, Africa and Israel.
Now, about three thousand small and medium merchants have this privilege through the new Special Notified Zone.
Many of the most reputed international names in the diamond industry have conducted over two hundred and forty four days of viewings.
My intention is to make India, which is already the cutting and polishing hub, into an International Diamond Trading Hub.
‘Make in India’ is one of them.
Our aim is to make India a preferred destination for manufacturing.
In the last fifty years, the gems and jewellery sector has accounted for four hundred and seventy five billion dollars of exports.
Skill India aims to ensure that new entrants to the work force have the necessary skills to contribute to the economy of the 21st century.
The gems and jewellery sector employs 4.6 million people.
Out of this, one million people are in the diamonds industry alone.
Thus the gems and jewellery sector is a prime example of the potential of ‘Make In India’ and Skill India.
Today, we have with us Ministers from several African countries.
India cherishes its excellent relations with Africa.
Our shared post-colonial heritage and the similarity of the challenges we face, make us natural partners.
I take this opportunity to assure my friends from Africa that India will be happy to support them in developing their gems and jewellery sector, and in training their technicians.
I began by saying that this sector has come a long way from where it was.
However it is still far behind where it should be.
Our strongest area is diamond cutting and polishing.
In terms of the global value in the gems and jewellery market, our share is lower than it should be.
Our future is much bigger than cutting and polishing alone.
We have a lot of unexplored potential.
Let me ask you a question: What is your strategy for increasing India’s share of the hand made jewellery market?
I am told that to a significant extent, Indian exports are importer-led: the specifications and designs are based on preferences given by importers.
This means that India is a follower of global fashion rather than a leader of global taste.
This does not do justice to our rich experience and abundant design talent.
Let me give an example.
India has many famous icons, sculptures and statues dating back over two thousand years.
Many of them are shown wearing jewellery.
These works of art have captivated people from around the world.
Have we documented these?
Even hair dressers change hair style fashions of their clients.
We live in an era where diamonds are used in spectacles, watches and pens.
Can’t our jewellers, with their skills, strengths and heritage, create and change global tastes and fashions?
In order to be able to influence and change global fashion, our industry first needs to have a thorough knowledge of its market.
The basic point is that we cannot be world leaders without first connecting strongly with the client.
E-commerce makes it much easier to establish direct contact with the end-user.
This is a golden opportunity for the Indian industry.
There was a time in the past where some products from India had achieved a global reputation.
I hope the industry is in constant touch with them.
Apart from exports, India as the fastest growing economy in the world will also see increased domestic demand.
What goals is the gems and jewellery industry setting for itself by that date?
What can you do for the country by then?
Where do you think the industry should be by then?
How will you get there?
How many new jobs can you create?
I call upon you to give this a serious thought and come up with a plan.
If changes are needed in regulations, I ask you to come up, with specific and practical suggestions.
We can certainly consider them if they are in the interest of our country.
I conclude by thanking you for this opportunity to share my thoughts.
I wish the conference all success.
The approved corridors will be having Multimodal Integration with Railway Stations &ISBT Station and will have feeder network of Bus, Intermediate Public Transport (IPT) and Non Motorised Transport (NMT).
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
Last year on 3rd October I had an opportunity to conduct my first ever “Mann Ki Baat”.
“Mann Ki Baat” – one year, many thoughts.
I am not sure of what you gained, but I can certainly say that I gained a lot.
In a democracy the power of the people is of great significance.
This thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why I have immense faith in the power of the people.
But with Mann Ki Baat whatever I was taught, whatever I was explained and the experiences I had, made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking.
Our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual.
My experience of “Mann Ki Baat” made me realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as I have myself experienced them.
I asked for suggestions for “Mann Ki Baat” and yet could touch upon just 3-4 of them.
But people continued to contribute actively in lakhs.
This in itself is a great power.
I did not feel that anyone got disheartened thinking that I wrote a letter to the PM or posted on mygov.in, yet my suggestions were not accepted even once.
Many things arose from the grass root level and reached the government.
It is true, the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom.
Who would have thought that the “Mann Ki Baat” will become a source of information?
But this has happened.
In the same way “Mann Ki Baat” became a platform to express the power of society.
I had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became.
The whole world was amazed.
Lakhs of people, perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters.
Whosoever saw it realized that they will now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters.
This was a kind of a silent revolution.
People sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of India.
Neither the Government of India nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage.
All things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny.
The people themselves took the task forward.
Today, I can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of Khadi have almost doubled.
Now see, there was no government advertisement.
Nor were lakhs and crores spent.
They took up every small cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country.
Can there be a bigger satisfaction than this?
This time I thought of conducting a new experiment through Mann Ki Baat.
I had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded.
I told them that I will take it up in Mann Ki Baat.
This is a pleasant experience in itself.
People of all age groups have sent messages.
I listened to some message personally and I liked them.
My team is working on the others.
You must have spent just a minute or two but for me your phone calls are very important.
The entire government will work on your suggestions.
But there was something which surprised me and made me equally happy.
These 55,000 people expressed themselves in their own way.
They were totally positive, suggestion oriented and constructive.
The reason may be that they are not able to watch T.V, but they must definitely be listening to the radio.
This made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people.
Pawan Acharya form Alwar, Rajasthan has sent me a message.
I believe that all of you should hear it and follow it.
I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme “Mann Ki Baat” to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali.
This will not only help the environment, but will also provide employment to many potter families.
So the earthen lamps will be valuable too.
It is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor man’s home.
Poor people earn their living this way.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the privilege of spending 2-3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces.
The jawans from our Army, Navy and Air force guarding our land, waters and skies.
This exhibition will last a few days.
I request you and your relatives living in Delhi and nearby areas to definitely visit it.
I came back in 2-2.5 hours but you will need 3-4 hours, do see it.
“Prime Minister, Modi ji, I want to tell you that, for the Swachhta Abhiyan (Cleaniness Drive) that you started, you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner”.
This child is absolutely right.
We should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness.
I got great satisfaction from this child’s message.
On the 2nd of October, I declared this cleanliness drive and I think something like this has happened for the first time after Independence because even in the parliament, cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days.
Our government is criticized as well.
I even have to listen to a lot of things; people say things like “Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened?”
I don’t get offended by all this.
I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India.
The self-governing regional bodies, be it Panchayats, municipal corporations, municipalities, municipal corporations of metropolitan cities, central government or state government – everybody will have to work on this.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say?
He once said, “if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later”.
Cleanliness was more important for Gandhi than freedom.
Come let us all follow what Mahatma Gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish.
Mr. Gulshan Arora from Delhi has left a message on MyGov.
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayal ji.
My dear fellow citizens, the lives of great men will always inspire us.
It is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men.
You pick any date; you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history.
We must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days, take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves.
I am saying it again, that Khadi begins a discounted sale from 2nd October onwards for one whole month.
You must all avail this sale.
Along with Khadi, handloom must also be given equal importance.
It will reach the poor widow who weaves Khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for Khadi at our homes and on our bodies this Diwali.
Look, last year we almost doubled the Khadi sale.
A lot of the poor have been benefitted.
Advertisements worth crores, by the government, cannot achieve what has been achieved through your help.
Dear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing.

Today, our election commission does not work only as a regulator but has become a facilitator, has become voter-friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies.

I publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food.
This is a holy act, everyone must do it.
At such a young age I saw that he was interested in research in the field of Physics.
I thought he must be reading a lot books, must be surfing internet, must be watching new experiments.
He was talking about things like, how to stop railway accidents, which technology to use, how to save money in producing energy, how to develop feelings in robots and what not.
He was an amazing kid.
Although I could not follow what he was saying, very closely, but I liked his confidence and his interest in so many things.
I want that kids in our country should develop more and more interest in science.
A kid should always ask these questions.

Sandeep ji, what all will you make me do?
I have to struggle even to make it to the monthly programme, have to make adjustments to my time-table.
Sometimes, our friends at Akashwani have to wait for an hour or so.
I still respect your feelings.
Do you know, how much did Subhash babu use the Radio?

Respected Dignitaries on the Dais
On this pious and sacred occasion, I offer my deep regards to Amma.
I also pray to the Almighty to give long life and good health to her.
She is the guiding light for millions of devotees.
Not only that, she has become the synonym of life for many devotees.
Like a real Maa, she nurtures her devotees through direct and indirect acts; visible and invisible hands.
I am very fortunate to be among those who have been receiving Amma’s blessings and unconditional love.
Three years ago, I had the opportunity to be present at Amritapuri, to pay my respects on the occasion of Amma’s 60th birthday celebrations.
Today, though I am not so lucky as to be present at the celebrations in person, I am delighted to be able to greet her, through technology.
India is the land of such saints who have seen God in everything that can be seen.
Mankind is prominent among those things.
That is why service to mankind has become their main motto.
I am aware that even in her childhood Amma was fond of giving her own food to others.
Serving the old and the aged, and helping the needy have been her childhood passions.
Also, she used to worship Lord Krishna in her childhood.
These two qualities have been her strength.
Devotion to God and Dedication to the Poor is thus, the message which I have personally taken from my association with Amma.
Millions of devotees from all over the world also believe in the same.
I am aware of the social and charitable works done by various institutions and programmes run by Amma.
I would like to particularly mention the works done and donations made in the field of sanitation, water, housing, education and health.
I understand that some of those beneficiaries will get their certificates today.
Today, I am informed that throughout the State, Amma’s ashram has already completed construction of two thousand toilets.
I know that this is just one example of various works being done in the fields of environmental conservation and sustainability.
One year ago, Amma generously donated one hundred crore rupees to the Namami Gange programme.
I am also aware of Amma’s helping hands to mitigate the sufferings in the aftermath of natural disasters.
It is also heartening to note that the Researchers at Amrita University are innovating new approaches to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems.
At the end, I would like to convey my sincere thanks for giving me the opportunity of joining the celebrations.

And, a Hindi-Portuguese dictionary is being developed for our mutual benefit.

I am happy to be at Cancer Institute, Adyar.
This is one of the oldest and most significant comprehensive cancer care centers in India.
Under Pradhan MantriSwasthya Suraksha Yojana,8existing institutions are being upgraded with provision of oncology services.The National Health Policy of 2017 under-lines the importance of preventive healthcare.
Under the Comprehensive Primary Health Care aspect of Ayushman Bharat, we will provide preventive and curative services at primary care level to people near their homes.
Ayushman Bharat also includes the Pradhan Mantri National Health Protection Mission.
Insurance coverage upto 5 lakh rupees per family, per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization will be provided under this mission.
This will be the world’s largest government funded health care programme.
To prevent, control and manage diseases like cancer we need action from all sections of society including NGOs and private sector.
I am informed that 30 percent of these beds are free beds, which means patients are not charged.
The molecular oncology department of the institute was designated a “Centre of Excellence” in 2007 by the Union Government.
The Union Government is committed to cooperative federalism.
Our mantra is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
The Prime Minister directed that all steps must be completed much before 1st April, 2017.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi delivered the following inaugural address at PETROTECH 2019 in Noida.
At the outset, I apologise for the delay due to logistical reasons.
I am delighted to welcome you all to PETROTECH-2019, the thirteenth edition of India’s flagship hydrocarbon Conference.
I would also like to congratulate His Excellency Dr. Sultan Al Jaber for his contribution to the energy sector and vision for the future.
In each of our respective countries, we seek to deliver affordable, efficient, clean and assured energy supplies to our citizens.
The presence of over sixty countries and seven thousand delegates here, is a reflection of that common quest.
Several decades of public life have convinced me that energy is a key driver of socio-economic growth.
Suitably priced, stable and sustainable energy supply, is essential for rapid growth of the economy.
It also helps the poor and deprived sections of society, to partake of economic benefits.
At the macro level, the energy sector is a pivot and key enabler of growth.
As we gather here to discuss the present and future of global energy, winds of change are evident in the global energy arena.
Energy supply, energy sources and energy consumption patterns are changing.
Perhaps, this could be a historic transition.
There is a shift in energy consumption from West to East.
The United States has become the world’s largest oil and gas producer after the shale revolution.
Solar energy and other renewable sources of energy have become more competitive.
They are emerging as sustainable substitutes for traditional energy forms.
Natural Gas is fast becoming one of the largest fuels in the global energy mix.
There are signs of convergence, between cheaper renewable energy, technologies, and digital applications.
This may expedite the achievement of many sustainable development goals.
Nations are coming together to tackle climate change.
This is visible in global partnerships, such as the International Solar Alliance, promoted by India and France.
We are entering an era of greater energy availability.
But more than a billion people across the globe still do not have access to electricity.
Many more do not have access to clean cooking fuel.
India has taken a lead in addressing these issues of energy access.
In our success, I see hope for the world that problems of energy availability can be suitably addressed.
People must have universal access to clean, affordable, sustainable and equitable supply of energy.
India’s contribution in the onset of an era based on energy justice is significant.
Currently, India is the fastest growing large economy in the world.
Leading agencies such as IMF and World Bank, project the same trend to continue in the coming years.
In an uncertain global economic environment, India has shown tremendous resilience as an anchor of the world economy.
India recently became the sixth largest economy in the world.
According to a recent report, by 2030, India could be the second largest world economy.
India remains an attractive market for energy companies with energy demand expected to more than double by 2040.
We have adopted an integrated approach towards energy planning.
During the last PETROTECH Conference in December 2016, I mentioned four pillars for India’s energy future.
These are energy access, energy efficiency, energy sustainability and energy security.
Energy justice is also a key objective for me, and a top priority for India.
Towards this end, we have developed and implemented many policies.
The results of these efforts are now evident.
Electricity has reached all our rural areas.
This year we aim to achieve hundred per cent electrification of households in India, through a targeted programme called SAUBHAGYA.
As we raise production, we also aim to reduce losses in transmission and distribution.
Under our UDAY scheme, we are working towards this objective.
India’s World Bank Ease of Getting Electricity Ranking, improved from one hundred and eleven in 2014 to twenty-nine in 2018.
Access to clean cooking fuel provides major benefits, especially to women and children at risk of exposure to smoke pollution.
LPG connections have been given to over sixty four million or 6.4 crore households in just under three years under the Ujjwala Scheme.
A ‘Blue Flame Revolution’ is underway.
LPG coverage has reached more than ninety percent, from fifty-five percent five years ago.
Clean Transportation is getting a boost.
We are jumping directly from BS four to BS six fuel by April 2020.
This is the equivalent of EURO six standards.
The bidding criterion has been changed to revenue sharing.
This has helped reduce government intervention.
An Open Acreage Licensing Policy and a National Data Repository is helping to increase exploration interest in Indian fields.
Gas pricing reforms have also been introduced.
The Enhanced Oil Recovery Policy aims to promote the use of latest technology in improving productivity of upstream fields.
Our downstream sector has been completely liberalized.
Market driven petrol and diesel prices reflect changes in the international price of crude oil.
India has the fourth largest refining capacity in the world.
This will further grow by about 200 million metric tons by 2030.
A National Biofuel Policy was enacted last year.
Research on second and third generation biofuels is being promoted.
Twelve second generation bio-refineries are being set up in eleven states.
The ethanol blending and biodiesel programme is reducing carbon emissions, and raising farmers’ incomes.
Bio Aviation Turbine Fuel has already been tried out in our civil aviation sector.
Our government has encouraged private participation across the entire oil and gas value chain.
India is becoming an attractive FDI destination.
Companies like Saudi Aramco, ADNOC, TOTAL, Exxon-Mobil, BP and Shell are looking to increase their investments across the value chain.
India is making rapid strides towards a gas based economy.
Over sixteen thousand kilometres of gas pipeline has been constructed and an additional eleven thousand kilometers is under construction.
Execution of three thousand, two hundred kilometers of gas pipeline in Eastern India has begun.
This will connect North East India with the National Gas Grid.
The tenth bid round for City Gas Distribution will be complete in a month’s time.
This will cover over four hundred districts.
It will extend coverage of City Gas Distribution to seventy percent of our population.
We are gearing up for Industry 4.0.
This will change the way industry operates, with new technology and processes.
Our companies are adopting latest technologies to improve efficiency, increase safety and reduce costs.
This is being done in downstream retail, as well as in upstream oil and gas production, asset maintenance and remote monitoring.
In recent years, we have deepened our international engagement with organizations such as the International Energy Agency, and OPEC.
We chaired the International Energy Forum from 2016 to 2018.
We have been able to convert our traditional buyer-seller engagements into strategic partnerships through bilateral investments.
We have also promoted our ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy by strengthening energy engagement with Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Myanmar.
I have regularly engaged with global CEOs from the oil and gas sector.
In my interactions with world leaders and CEOs, I have always maintained that Oil and Gas are not only a commodity of trade but also of necessity.
Whether it is for the kitchen of a common man or for an aircraft, energy is essential.
We also need to move towards transparent and flexible markets for both oil and gas.
Only then can we serve the energy needs of humanity in an optimal manner.
Another key issue that needs the world to come together is climate change.
Together, we can achieve the targets we set for ourselves at COP-21 in Paris.
PETROTECH provides the perfect setting to ponder over the future of the energy sector.
It is a good platform to reflect on how global shifts, transitions, policies and new technologies will influence market stability and future investments in the sector.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will visit Madurai, Tamilnadu on January 27, 2019.
These projects are a part of Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana which aims to set up 20 AIIMS across the country out of which six have already been established, and to upgrade 73 medical colleges across the country.
I am happy to inaugurate the World Congress on Information Technology.
This event is being held in India for the first time.
It has been organized in partnership with NASSCOM, WITSA and the Government of Telangana.
On the side-lines of this conference, I hope you shall have some time to explore the vibrant history, and delectable cuisine of Hyderabad.
I am sure, it shall encourage you to visit other parts of India as well.
Indeed, India is home to ancient, rich and diverse cultures, through which runs an under-lying theme of unity.
The concept of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam– the world is one family”, is deeply imbibed in Indian philosophy.
It reflects our inclusive traditions.
IN the twenty-first century, technology is becoming an enabler or this concept.
It helps us create a seam-less, integrated world.
A world where geographical distance no longer remains a barrier in collaborating for a better future.
We were and we remain one of the most tech friendly populations in the world.
With over one lakh villages linked with optical fiber, 121 crore Mobile phones, 120 crore Adjara and 50 crore internet users,
India is best placed to leverage the power of technology and leap-frog into the future while ensuring empowerment of every citizen.
Leveraging technology in such a holistic manner was unthinkable some years ago.
We have successfully completed this life-cycle in the last 3 and a half years.
This has been possible through a change in public behavior and processes.
Digital India has not remained merely a Government initiative, but has become a way of life.
Technology has transcended power-point presentations and has become an inseparable part of people’s lives.
While most Government initiatives depend on a Government push, Digital India is succeeding because of the people’s pull.
Around 22 million digital hospital transactions across 172 hospitals in India are bringing comfort in the lives of patients.
The National Scholarship Portal for easy Scholarships today has 14 million students registered on it.
Digital payments through BHIM-UPI has registered transactions of Rupees fifteen thousand Crore in January 2018.
The unique Umang app launched only three months back is already offering 185 Government services.
Today 2.8 lakh Common Services Centers are there in different parts of the country giving many digital services to people.
To ensure digital literacy in every house-hold, we have initiated a Pradhan Mantri Rural Digital Literacy Mission to make 60 million adults digitally literate in rural India.
Under this10 million people have already been trained.
We have come a long way with the convergence of Make In India & Digital India.
It enables small and medium enterprises to compete in meeting the procurement requirements of the Government.
This simple IT framework has improved transparency in Government procurement.
Yesterday, at Mumbai University, I had the opportunity to dedicate to the nation, the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
A few days ago, in Dubai, at the World Government Summit, I had the opportunity to visit an exhibition on the “Museum of the Future.”
This has been planned as an incubator for ideas, and a driver for innovation.
I appreciate the pioneers of technology, some of whom are in the audience today, for the work they are doing.
They are helping to secure a better, more comfortable future for humanity.
We stand today, at the cusp of the fourth Industrial Revolution.
Technology, if used well for public good, can deliver lasting prosperity to mankind and a sustainable future for our planet.
It is in this context, that I place the World Conference on Information Technology, in India today.
The key themes at this Conference, reflect the opportunities that await us.
Skilling citizens for the workplace of the future is Important.
In India, we have launched the National Skill Development Mission to prepare our children and youth for a bright future.
We also need to ensure that our existing work-forces able to re-skill, as new technologies emerge.
One of the invited speakers at this event, the robot Sophia shows the potential of new technologies.
I am told, NASSCOM has identified eight important technologies.
They include Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Robotic Process Automation, Internet of Things,
Big Data Analytics, 3D Printing, Cloud Computing, Social and Mobile.
NASSCOM has also identified fifty-five job roles that are going to be in high demand globally.
I am sure, the “skills of future” platform will greatly help India maintain its competitive edge.
Digital technology is now at the heart of every business.
New technologies must be embedded in various operations and processes of a business entity.
How can we prepare our millions of small and medium businesses for this transformation, in a short time?
Keeping in mind the importance of innovation, in the future of economy and business, the Government of India has launched the Start-up India initiative.
We believe our startups are the key to finding viable and economical solutions across sectors and verticals.
Under the Atal Innovation Mission, we are building Atal Tinkering Labs in schools across India.
The objective of this scheme is to foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in young minds.
I am sure, that as you deliberate on various themes of Information Technology, you shall keep the interests of the common man at the back of your mind.
I once again welcome the distinguished delegates from across the world, to India.
May your deliberations be productive?
My dear countrymen, my greetings (namaskar) to you all
Last year, we had to endure so many trials – the scorching heat of the summer, scarcity of water, drought conditions and so on.
This news in itself charges us with a lot of enthusiasm.
I extend my greetings to all our farmer brethren hoping for a bountiful rainfall.
In our country, like the toiling farmers, our scientists are also achieving success on many fronts to take our country to new heights.
I also want to share another bright news with you.
Yesterday I had gone to Pune, on the occasion of the anniversary of the Smart City Project.
Over there I met those students of the Pune College of Engineering, who on their own have made a satellite, which was launched on 22nd June.
For the past many years, several students have made their contributions to this project.
In a way, this academic satellite is a living example of the soaring flight of courage and ambition of the young India.
That has led these our students to make this satellite.
On similar lines as achieved by these Pune students, the students of Satyabhama University of Chennai in Tamil Nadu also created their satellite; and their SathyabamaSAT has also been launched.
We have been hearing these things since childhood, and every child wishes deep inside his heart to touch the sky and grab a few stars.
Keeping this in mind, in my opinion, these two satellites made by the students and launched by ISRO, are extremely important and most valuable.
All these students deserve hearty congratulations.
I also want to congratulate the people of the country that on 22nd June, our scientists at ISRO launched 20 satellites simultaneously into space, and in the process set a new record, breaking their own previous records.
And this is also a matter of joy that of the twenty satellites which were launched in India, 17 satellites were from other countries.
My dear Countrymen, “Save the Girl Child, Educate the Girl Child” (Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao), has already become the Mann Ki Baat, the heartfelt wish of all the people of India.
Still, some incidents infuse a new life into this slogan.
You must have noticed that all these three daughters do not hail from metro cities of India.
They do not even come from the capital cities of their respective states.
Despite hailing from small cities and towns, they nurtured dreams as high as the sky, and they also made them come true.
I extend my heartiest wishes to these three daughters Avni, Bhawana and Mohana as well as their parents.
My dear Countrymen, a few days ago on 21st June, the whole world organised grand shows in observance of the anniversary of the International Day for Yoga.
As an Indian, when we witness the entire world coming together through Yoga, we realize that the entire world is getting linked with our past, present and future.
We are forging a unique bond with the rest of the world.
In India too, the International Yoga Day was celebrated at over 1 lakh places, with a lot of fervour and enthusiasm in myriad forms and hues, and in an atmosphere of gaiety.
I also got an opportunity to perform Yoga in Chandigarh amidst thousands of Yoga lovers.
It was worth watching the zeal of the young and old alike.
You must have seen that last week the Indian government issued a postage stamp on ‘Surya Namaskar’ on the occasion of International Yoga Day.
Tell me, which Indian would not feel proud at such happenings?
Social media has created an identity of its own.
And this time Twitter carried out a light hearted pleasant experiment in Yoga with its ‘Yoga imaging’.
Yoga has the power to connect the entire world.
But for that to happen, first all of us need to get connected to Yoga.
Swati Srivastava from Satna in Madhya Pradesh, called me up on telephone after the Yoga Day and left a message for all of you but it seems that it pertains more to me: –
And I have seen that there are some countries in the world which have T.V. channels exclusively dedicated to Yoga 24 hours a day.
And you probably know that, during the month of June, in view of the International Yoga Day, I used to share a video everyday of one particular asana of Yoga through Twitter and Face Book.
If you go to the website of the Ministry of Ayush, you will see available there a 40-45 minutes very good video demonstrating one after another, different kinds of yog asanas for different parts of the body that you can do, people of all ages can do.
To you and through you to all the people interested in Yoga, I would like to exhort to get connected to it.
This time I have made an appeal.
Can we control Diabetes through Yoga?
Some people have been successful in that.
One has to manage it with medicines.
Diabetes is the master switch that triggers all other illnesses.
Some diabetic patients have also been able to control it thorough their yogic practice.
Why don’t we share our experiences with other people to impart a momentum to this endeavour and create a kind of atmosphere for it for an entire year?
My dear countrymen, sometimes my ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is ridiculed a lot and is criticized much also.
However, this can only happen because all of us are committed to democracy.
All the rights of the citizens were suspended.
The country was turned into a prison.
Lakhs of people along with Jai Prakash Narain, thousands of leaders, many organisations were put behind bars.
Many books have been written on that dark period.
Many discussions have been held on it.
But today, as I talk to you all on 26th June, we should not forget that our strength lies in our democracy.
We have to carry forward this commitment and make it stronger.
And it is this people’s power which has sustained democracy as its living embodiment.
I always stress that Democracy doesn’t merely mean that people vote for you and give you the contract to run this country for five years.
The chasm between the governments and the people leads to ruin.
My endeavour has always been to ensure that the nation moves forward on the strength of people’s participation.
Recently, when my government completed two years of functioning, some young people of modern thinking suggested, “When you talk such big things about democracy, then why don’t you get your government rated by the people also.”
In a way it had a tone of challenge as well as advice.
But that stirred my mind.
These days technology has changed so much that if people get together and form a group and if they decide to misuse technology, then who knows in which direction they might take forward this survey.”
Now a lot of surveys are conducted after the elections, during the elections, at other times also over some issues, sometimes to gauge the popularity, but the sample size of these surveys is not very big.
Lakhs of you displayed your interest in this but 3 lakh people devoted their time and put in serious effort for giving an answer to each and every question.
I am grateful to these 3 lakh people that they displayed a lot of self initiative in rating the government.
But I can say for sure that it was a good experiment.
And this was a matter of joy for me that people speaking all the languages of India, residing in every corner of the country, hailing from all types of background… all of them participated in it.
And the biggest thing was… and this, of course, came as a surprise to me… that maximum number of people took part in this exercise through the portal of the website of the Rural Employment Scheme which is being run by the government.
Thus, my primary impression is that there has been a large and active participation of people connected to rural India and poverty issues.
This I liked the most.
This is the real power of democracy.
My dear countrymen, today I want to make a special appeal for one thing.
There was a time when taxes were so pervasive, that it became a habit to avoid taxation.
There was a time when there were many restrictions imposed on bringing foreign goods into the country which gave rise to a lot of smuggling.
But gradually, times have changed.
Now it is not very difficult for the taxpayer to get connected with the taxation system of the government.
But even then, old habits die hard.
One generation still feels that it is best to keep away from the government.
Today I want to impress upon you that we end up losing our peace of mind by trying to escape from rules and regulations.
As a result, anybody can trouble and harass us.
Why should we let this happen?
I appeal to the countrymen to do this.
To the people who have undisclosed income, the Government of India has given a chance to declare such income.
The government has presented before the country a special facility to disclose undisclosed income by the 30th of September.
We can be free ourselves of various burdens just by paying a fine.
I have also promised that for those who voluntarily declare to the government their assets and their undisclosed income, then the government will not conduct any kind of enquiry.
Not once will it be asked as to from where all this wealth came and how it was acquired.
And so, this is a good chance for you to become a part of a transparent system.
At the same time, I want to tell the people of the country that please consider this plan, which is up to 30th September as your last chance.
In between, I had even told the Members of the Parliament that after 30th September if any citizen is put through any difficulty, the one who does not want to follow due rules of government, then it will not be possible to help them.
I want to say this to the people of the country that we do not wish that after the 30th September anything should happen that will cause difficulties for you.
And so I say that please avail of this facility before this date and save yourselves from any possible trouble after the 30th of September.
If they want to follow rules, we should encourage them, and lovingly help them cross over.
It is important to build an atmosphere of trust.
We shall have to bring about a change through our conduct.
We shall have to reassure the taxpayer.
I stressed this upon them and I noticed that they too realized that today when the nation is surging ahead, all of us must contribute to it.
And when I was taking inputs from them in this conclave, I gathered information which I want to share with you as well.
People having a taxable income of more than 50 lakh rupees can be seen in big cities in large numbers.
Just looking at their bungalows worth 1 or 2 crores, one wonders how they can be in a tax bracket of less than 50 lakhs.
Before taking any extreme steps, the government must give a chance to the people.
And so my dear brothers and sisters, this is a golden chance for you to disclose your undisclosed income.
And in another way, this is the way out to save yourself from any trouble that could arise after 30th September.
My dear countrymen, the common man of this country is always looking for a chance to do something for the country.
When I asked the people to give up their cooking gas subsidy, more than 1 crore families of this country voluntarily gave up their subsidy.
And now I want to cite an example especially for those people who have undisclosed income.
Do you know what the reason is?
Shri Chandrakant Kulkarni is an ordinary man who belongs to an average middle class family.
He used to work for the government.
Then he retired.
He receives a pension of sixteen thousand rupees.
And my dear countrymen, you will be surprised to hear, and those who are in the habit of evading tax will get a shock to know that Chandrakant Kulkarni Ji, who gets a pension of only rupees sixteen thousand, some time back wrote a letter to me saying that out of his pension of 16,000, he voluntarily wants to donate Rs. 5000 per month for the Cleanliness Campaign.
And not just this, he sent me 52 cheques, post dated, which bear a date for each forthcoming month.
Come, let us search deep down inside our hearts, and ponder over the fact that the government has given us an opportunity to disclose our incomes.
While thinking of Chandrkant Kulkarni, let us also follow him.
My dear countrymen, Santosh Negi from Pauri Garhwal in Uttarakhand, has called up to relate one of his experiences.
He has given a message regarding water conservation.
Friends, his experience can be of use to you as well: –
Sound Byte: “Drawing inspiration from you, in our school, before the onset of monsoon we dug 250 small trenches which were 4 feet deep, along the side of the playground, so that rainwater could be collected in these.
Pauri Garhwal is a hilly area where you have done such splendid work.
You deserve congratulations for that.
The people of our country should certainly enjoy the rains but let us also be mindful that this is a holy gift from the Almighty.
This is a limitless wealth.
We should make every effort to conserve every single drop of water.
How can we retain the rainwater of the villages there itself and similarly preserve rainwater of cities therein.
To recharge Mother Earth once again, how can we replenish water back to the earth?
Lately, in all the states a lot of measures have been taken for water conservation.
But now that we are going to have the bounty of rain water, we must see to it that it doesn’t just flow away.
We are so concerned about saving lives; we should be equally concerned about saving water.
This 1922 is one such number that if you give a missed call to it, you can listen to Mann Ki Baat in the language of your choice.
By listening to Mann Ki Baat, at the time of your convenience, in the language of your choice, you too can make up your mind and resolve to contribute to the journey of the nation’s progress.
But, we also see the changing character of terrorism: global links, franchise relations, home-grown terrorism and use of cyber space for recruitment and propaganda.
The world must speak in one voice and act in unison against terrorism, without any political considerations.
There should be no distinction between terrorist groups or discrimination between states.
We must isolate those who support and sponsor terrorism; and, stand with those who share our values of humanism.
We need to restructure the international legal framework to deal with the unique challenges of terrorism.
We should also adopt a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism without any delay.
International cooperation in intelligence and counter-terrorism should increase.
We should strengthen efforts to prevent supply of arms to terrorists, disrupt terrorist movements, and curb and criminalise terror financing.
We have to help each other secure our cyber space, and minimize use of internet and social media for terrorist activities.
We need to delink terror and religion and work together to counter radicalization.
It is equally important to promote broader peace and stability in West Asia and Africa.
This is also required for addressing the current refugee crisis.
Today, there are an estimated 60 million people in need of protection worldwide.
We thank the countries that have opened their borders and shelters.

It is a day of enormous significance for you here in Sri Lanka, for us in India, and for Buddhists around the world.
And, I am most grateful to Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena, Excellency Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the people of Sri Lanka for extending to me the honourto be the Chief Guest at the International Vesak Day festivitiesin Colombo.
On this auspicious occasion, I also bring with me the greetings of 1.25 billion people from the land of the Samyaksambuddha,the perfectly self awakened one.
Excellencies, and Friends,
Bodh Gaya in India, where Prince Siddhartha became the Buddha, is the sacred nucleus of the Buddhist universe.
Our key national symbols have taken inspiration from Buddhism.
Buddhism and its various strandsare deep seated in our governance, cultureand philosophy.
The divine fragrance of Buddhism spread from India to all corners of the globe.
Mahindra and Sanghamitra, the worthy children of King Ashokamade their journey from India to Sri Lankaas धम्मा दूत to spread the biggest gift of धम्मा.
And, as Buddha had himself said:सब्ब्दानामधम्मादानं जनाती, meaning, the gift of धम्मा is the biggest gift of all.
Today, Sri Lanka takes pride in being among the most important nerve centres of Buddhist teachings and learning.
Centuries later,Anagarika Dharmapala undertook a similar journey, but this time, from Sri Lanka to India to revive the spirit of Buddhain the land of its origin.
In some way, you took us back to our own roots.
The world also owes a debt of gratitude to Sri Lanka for preserving some of the most important elements of the Buddhist heritage.
Vesak is an occasion for us to celebrate this unbroken shared heritage of Buddhism.
A heritage that connects our societies across generations and through centuries.
As close neighbours, our relationship spreads across many layers.
It draws its strength as much through our interconnected values of Buddhism as it does from the limitless possibilities of our shared future.
Ours is a friendship that lives in the hearts of our peopleand in the fabric of our societies.
To honour and deepen our links of Buddhist heritage, I have the great pleasure to announce that from August this year,Air India will operate direct flights between Colombo and Varanasi.
Venerable Monks, Excellencies and Friends,
I believe we are at a moment of great opportunity in our ties with Sri Lanka.
An opportunity to achieve a quantum jump in our partnership across different fields.
And, for us, the most relevant benchmark for the success of our friendship is your progress and success.
We are committed to the economic prosperity of our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters.
We will continue to invest in driving positive change and economic growth to deepen our development cooperation.
Our strength lies in sharing our knowledge, capacity and prosperity.
In trade and investment, we are already significant partners.
We believe that free flow of trade, investments, technology, and ideas across our borders will be to our mutual benefit.
India’s rapid growthcan bring dividends for the entire region, especially in Sri Lanka.
In infrastructure and connectivity,transport and energy,we are poised to scale up our cooperation.
Our development partnership stretches across nearly every sector of human activity such as agriculture, education, health, resettlement, transport, power, culture, water, shelter, sports, and human resources.
Today,India’s development cooperation with Sri Lankaamounts toUS Dollars 2.6 billion.
And, its only aim is to support Sri Lanka in realizing a peaceful, prosperous and secure future for its people.
Because, the economic and social well being of the people of Sri Lankais linked with that of 1.25 billion Indians.
Because, whether it is on land or in the waters of the Indian Ocean, the security of our societies is indivisible.
Lord Buddha’s message is as relevant in the twenty first century as it was two and a half millennia ago.
The मध्यम प्रतिपदा , the Middle Path shown by Buddha, speaks to all of us.
Its universality and evergreen nature is striking.
It has been a unifying force among nations.
The countries of South, Central, South East and East Asia are proud of their Buddhist links traced to the land of Buddha.
The themes of Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace,chosen for the Vesak day,resonate deeply with Buddha’s teachings.
I firmly believe that Buddhism’s message of peace is the answer to growing arc of violence all over the world.
And, not just a negative notion of peace defined by the absence of conflict.
But, a positive peace where we all work to promote dialogue, harmony and justice, based on compassion and wisdom.
As Buddha said,”नत्तीसंतिपरणसुखं”, “there is no higher bliss than peace”.
Thank you once again for the honour to be with you.
I look forward to paying homage at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, in Kandy today afternoon.

We will pursue this in three ways:

These are agriculture, science and technology, and security.
You will find this reflected in the agreements that were just exchanged.
Several of these areas are indicative of our desire to diversify and broad-base engagement.
we are committed to facilitating the flow of people and ideas between our geographies.
It requires policy facilitation, infrastructure and connectivity links and fostering constituencies of support beyond Government.
We have also decided to start an annual exchange of bilateral visits by 100 young people from science-related educational streams.
Thriving two-way trade and investment is an integral part of our vision for a strong partnership.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I agreed on the need to do more in this direction.
After the meeting in Tel Aviv last year, we will interact for the second time with our CEOs under the bilateral Forum.
I welcome the large business component that Prime Minister Netanyahu has brought along with him.
We are both countries that have never forgotten our history and our heroes.

As we look to the future of this exciting partnership with Israel, I am filled with hope and optimism.
In Prime Minister Netanyahu, I have a counter-part who is equally committed to taking the India-Israel relationship to soaring new heights.

The agreement that was exchanged just now has institutionalized this understanding.
UAE is one of our most valued partners and a close friend in an important region of the world.
I have just concluded very fruitful and productive discussions with His Highness.
We particularly focused on implementation of various decisions taken during our last two meetings.
We agreed to sustain the momentum of our relations in key areas, including energy and investments.
We regard UAE as an important partner in India’s growth story.
I particularly welcome UAE’s interest in investing in India’s infrastructure sector.
We are working to connect the institutional investors in UAE with our National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.

Yunmo Sung, Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy,
Distinguished Business Leaders,
A very good afternoon.
I am delighted to meet you all today in Seoul.
This is my third interaction with the Korean business leaders in the span of just 12 months.
I wish to see more and more Korean businesses turning their attention to India.
Even when I was the Chief Minister of the state of Gujarat, I traveled to Korea.
Korea was, and still remains, a role-model of economic growth for me.
· An economy that is closed to one that is globally inter-linked;
· An economy that is known for its red tape, to one known for its red carpet.
India has emerged as a land of opportunities.
While we work for realizing the ‘Indian Dream’, we seek like-minded partners.
And, among them, we see South Korea is truly natural partner.
Our trade volume has reached 21.5 billion Dollars for the calendar year 2018.
And, Korean investments into India have reached a cumulative figure of almost 6 billion Dollars.
After my visit to Korea in 2015, we launched a Korea specific facilitation cell “Korea Plus” under ‘Invest India’ to guide, assist and handhold investors during the entire life-cycle of the business.
Hyundai, Samsung, LG electronics have become trustworthy brands in India.
And, Kia is soon to join this club.
Over 600 Korean companies have invested in India.
And, we aspire to welcome many more.
And, to ease your path, Visa on Arrival for Korean nationals has been put in place since October last year.
In the last four years, we have jumped 65 places in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking, to 77th.
In India, we are also focused on making our growth inclusive.
Under the Mudra scheme, we have extended micro credit worth more than 90 billion dollars to 128 million persons over the past three years.
74 percent of these loans have gone to women.
We have taken huge strides in rural electrification.
Under the Sagarmala Project, Port projects involving Investment of over 10 billion Dollars have been identified for award in the upcoming five years.
Research and innovation would be the driving force in 4th industrial revolution era.
South Korean National IT Industry promotion Agency has already opened their Indian office in Bengaluru to facilitate Korean startups to India.
In the field of innovation, both countries have decided to establish ‘India-Korea Future Strategy Group’ and ‘India-Korea Centre for research and Innovation Cooperation’ to provide an institutional framework for future-oriented cooperation based on research, innovation and entrepreneurship.
It is our earnest desire to work with Republic of Korea more closely to realize the dream of our citizens.
Efforts by the Governments will not be realized unless business leaders like you share the same dreams.
I would like to conclude here with Korean expression:
I entirely agree with its meaning, that, “you would go fast if you go alone, but you would go far if you go together”.

Minister for Energy, Saudi Arabia
Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, India
Secretary General, International Energy Forum
Welcome to India.
Welcome to the 16thInternational Energy Forum Ministerial Meeting.
I am happy to see such a large participation of Energy Ministers from producing and consuming nations, Heads of International Organisations and CEOs in this forum.
• Consumption growth has shifted to non OECD countries: Middle East, Africa and developing Asia;
• Solar Photo-Voltaic energy has become economical compared to all other energy sources.
This is changing the supply paradigm (पैरा-डाइम);
• Abundant availability of natural gas globally with increased percentage of LNG and natural gas is contributing to the primary energy basket;
• The Transport sector will see massive changes in the next few decades with adoption of electric vehicles;
• The World is committedto the climate change agendabased on the COP-21agreement.
The energy intensity of economies will change with focus on green energy and energy efficiency;
Let me share with you some of my thoughtson the hydrocarbon sector and our endeavourto achieve energy security.
The world has for too long seen prices on a roller-coaster.
If the world has to grow as a whole,there has to be a mutually supportive relationship between producers and consumers.
It is in the interests of producersthat other economies keep growing steadily and rapidly.
This will ensure growing energy markets for them.
Efforts at artificially distorting prices are self-defeating,as history has shown us.
They also cause undue hardships,particularly to those at the bottom of the pyramid in developing and least developed countries.
Given global un-certainties,India also needs energy security.My vision for India’s energy future has 4 pillars– energy access, energy efficiency, energy sustainability and energy security.
Energy in general and hydrocarbons in particularare an important part of my vision for India’s future.
India needs energy which is accessibleand affordable to the poor.
It needs efficiency in energy use.
Currently,India is the fastest growing large economy in the world.
All leading agencies such as IMF, World Bank, and ADB are estimating India to grow at 7 to 8 percent in the near future.
Our Government is boosting local manufacturing through Make in Indiaand skilling of youth in industries such as textile, petro-chemical, defence, engineering etc.This, in turn, is alsoincreasing our energy consumption further.
We have also revampedour up-stream policies and regulationsand brought transparency and competitiveness in the sectorthrough the launch of Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy.
The Enhanced Oil Recovery Policyaims to promote the use of latest technologyin improving productivity of up-stream fields.
Our Down-stream sectorhas been completely liberalizedwith market driven petrol and diesel pricesreflecting the changes in price of crude oil.
We have moved towards digital platformsin fuel retail and payments.
Our government has encouraged private participationacross the entire oil and gas value chainfrom up-stream production to down-stream retail.
Universal access to modern energy by 2030;
Urgent action to tackle climate change – in line with the Paris agreement;
Measures to improve air quality;
In India, throughthe UjjwalaYojana we provide free LPG connections to women from poorhouseholds.
In fact, here in New Delhi,we have already started offering BS Six standard fuel this month.
Our oil companies are assessing all their investmentskeeping in view the energy diversification strategies.
The theme of IEF-16 is “The Future of Global Energy Security.”
I am told that the Agenda aims to address issues like global shifts in producer–consumer relations, universal energy accessand affordability,and promoting investments in oil and gas to meet future demand.Maintaining energy security and co-existence of new and existing technologies are also to come up for discussion.
These are all pertinentsubjects for the future of our collective energy security.
I believe that the discussions at this forumwill go a long way in benefitting the world citizens in accessingclean, affordable and sustainable energy.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Tajikistan on Cooperation on Youth Matters.

Over the last three years, I have been constantly telling the domestic and foreign investor community that we in India are making sincere efforts to improve ‘ease of doing business’.
• Because it is a measure of the quality of our public policies;
• Because it is a benchmark of transparency of processes;
• Because, ease of doing business, also leads to ease of life;
• And, ultimately, it reflects the way people live, work and transact in a society.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today visited EMERCOM –the National Crisis Management Centre (NCMC) in Moscow.
The Prime Minister was given an overview of the actual functioning and real-time monitoring operations of the Centre.
He was informed in detail about the coordination among various disaster-relief agencies, which is done by this Centre.
The space monitoring and 3D modelling capabilities were also explained.
The capabilities of the Centre to monitor threats to human life and property, including natural disasters, both within and beyond Russia’s borders, and its global sphere of cooperation were highlighted.
The Prime Minister took keen interest in the disaster prevention and response activities being coordinated by the Centre, as well as its global outreach.
He described the work being done by the Centre as a “great service to humanity.”
The National Security Advisor Shri AjitDoval, the Foreign Secretary Shri S. Jaishankar, the Defence Secretary Shri G Mohan Kumar, and other senior members of the Prime Minister’s delegation were present.
The capabilities of the NCMC include state of the art real time monitoring, data collection, analysis and modelling.
Before I begin, I would like to share with you, some recent, remarkable achievements of our scientists in India.
Last month, our space scientists created a unique record.
They sent 104 satellites into space, through a single rocket launch.
101 of these satellites were owned by countries such as USA, Israel, Switzerland, Netherlands, Kazakhstan and UAE.
Our defence scientists too, have made India proud.
I congratulate our space and defence scientists for their achievements.
Perhaps, there can be no better place than Rishikesh, to host the International Yoga Festival.
And in most cases, that quest, has led them, to Yoga.
Yoga is a code to connect people with life, and to reconnect mankind with nature.
That is why, Swami Vivekananda said, “expansion is life, contraction is death.”
By practicing Yoga, a spirit of oneness is created – oneness of the mind, body and the intellect.
Yoga is the journey from ‘me’ to ‘we.’
Yoga makes the individual a better person in thought, action, knowledge and devotion.
It would be very unfair to see Yoga only as a set of exercises that keeps the body fit.
Yoga is far beyond physical exercises.
The quest for solace from the stresses of modern life, often drives people to tobacco, alcohol, or even drugs.
Yoga offers a timeless, simple, and healthy alternative.
There is ample evidence that practicing yoga helps combat stress and chronic lifestyle-related conditions.
The world today, is also threatened by the twin challenges – terrorism, and climate change.
The world looks to India, and to Yoga, for a durable, and sustainable answer to these problems.
Only peaceful families can constitute peaceful society.
Only peaceful individuals can make peaceful families.
Yoga is the way to create such a harmony and peace within individuals, family, society, nation and ultimately all over the world.
When we talk of combating climate change, we seek to move away from a lifestyle of consumption, or “Bhoga”, to one of Yoga.
Yoga can prove to be a strong pillar to lead a life of discipline and development.
At a time, when emphasis is on personal gain, and what one may get out of any endeavour, Yoga offers a refreshingly different approach.
Yoga is not about what one can get out of it.
It is rather about what one can give up, what one can get rid of.
Therefore, instead of attainment, Yoga shows us the path to liberation, or Mukti, as we call it in this part of the world.
Swami Chidanand Saraswati ji, through his work at Parmarth Niketan has shown a way to live these noble ideals.
I appreciate the work being done by Parmarth Niketan in bringing Yoga to people across the world.
Remarkably, Swamiji and his team have accomplished this mission in less than a quarter of a century.
And the depth of their work is amazing.
They were able to include almost all aspects of Hinduism in only 11 volumes.
This is indeed, a possession that can benefit every spiritual seeker, yogi, and even a common person.
Works like Encyclopaedia of Hinduism, when made available in various languages, increase the under-standing and enhance the awareness of other traditions and cultures within the country.
Accumulation of any form of waste or filth within the four walls of these places is considered impure.
Even in our ancient scriptures, this importance of personal hygiene is captured.
There is, however, a tendency to dump dirt in open spaces.
This is not true for western and other developed countries, where the link between community hygiene and public health is more clearly understood.
Awareness and observance of hygiene of public goods like water bodies, land and air is crucial.
Therefore, good health is a collective effort of personal well-being and environmental well-being.
Through the Swachh Bharat Mission, we are attempting to establish the link between community hygiene and personal health.
Historically temples have played a key role in our societies.
Usually they were built at a vast area of land, and often away from the residential areas.
However, with passage of time, they were surrounded by markets, and residential colonies.
And hence, they face unclean surroundings as a major challenge.
Swachh Bharat Mission, therefore, now includes the Project “Swachh Iconic Places” to address this issue.
And therefore, Swachh Bharat Mission – the quest for clean India – is linked to faith and spirituality in the country.
I must confess, I did not imagine the spontaneous outpouring of support that followed.
An unprecedented number of countries from across the world, joined hands with us.
And now, every year, on the occasion of Summer Solstice – June 21 – the world comes together, for Yoga.
The coming together of so many nations to mark the International Day of Yoga illustrates the real essence of Yoga – togetherness.
Yoga has the potential to herald in a new Yuga (a new era) – a Yuga of peace, compassion, brotherhood and all-round progress of the human race.
May the blessings of the mighty Himalayas be with you.
May you find fulfilment and bliss, in this great festival of Yoga, on the banks of the River Ganga, where our sages and rishis have meditated for millennia.
May you enjoy your stay in the spiritual city of Rishikesh, and the divine surroundings of Parmarth Niketan.
May Yoga be of benefit to one and all.
I wish the International Yoga Festival a grand success.
But, we in India face its consequences today.
We see it in the risks of our farmers, the changes in weather patterns, and the intensity of natural disasters.
This will mean a partnership in which those who have the luxury of choices and the capability of technology will make adjustments to sharply reduce their carbon emission.
The divine has manifested in Nature’s diverse forms.
We have always believed that Nature does not exist for human race, but that we can’t exist without Nature.
So, Nature is meant to provide and nurture, not to exploit.
For, the enduring success of our efforts will depend on the way we live and think.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, was today presented with a unique artwork made of pearls.

“Have seen the news about a Temple being built in my name.
I was appalled.
This is shocking and against India`s great traditions.
Building such Temples is not what our culture teaches us.
Personally, it made me very sad.
Would urge those doing it not to do it.
If you have time and resources, please devote the same towards fulfilling our dream of a Clean India,” the Prime Minister said.
My heartfelt thanks to Finance Minister Sri Arun Jaitley ji for this budget.
Our focus is on the villages, poor, farmers, women and the youth.
The budget has plans for ambitious schemes to bring in a qualitative change in their lives.
This budget presents a comprehensive , time bound action plan for poverty alleviation.
Several measures have been outlined to double the income of the farmers.
All of us know the importance of power and road infrastructure .
There is a vision in this budget to connect every village to road by 2019.
It will give an impetus to rural economy and bring about positive changes .If you ask a poor man, he will clearly share his dream.
That’s why provisions have been made this time to give impetus to the housing sector and ensure a house to general household.
People who are living in rented house have also got increased rebate in Income Tax over House Rent.
Those who are earning up to 5 lakhs will have to pay lesser tax.
There has been a lot of politics over the poor.
You will be amazed to know that if a poor lady who cooks food for her children using a Chulha faces adverse impact on her and her children’s health.
Experts say that the smoke of that chulha , is equivalent to the smoke of 400 cigarettes per day.
We have to help people below the poverty line and that’s why we have decided to provide free gas connection to such people.
5 crore families who use chulha for cooking will get freedom from smoke.
Poor will get health benefits and environment will protected as well.
Our government is also taking important decisions in health sector.
At times, an ailment can destroy life of a poor family or a middle class family or a neo middle class family.
We have presented schemes for senior citizens who are in dire need of help.
Our country should be safe, our citizens should feel safe and our forces should be equipped with modern defence equipment and our soldiers should get One Rank One Pension post retirement.
This budget has made provisions for boosting defence manufacturing and providing the armed forces with modern and potent equipment.
You might have seen that in infrastructure a provision of more than 2 lakh crore Rupees has been made.
This will benefit our forces who are guarding our borders.
The youth of the country is moving ahead.
In order to provide him employment opportunities we are going to come out with two new initiatives, ‘formalizing the informal’ and ‘employing the unemployed.’
My Mantra is Start Up India, Stand Up India.
To provide a favorable ecosystem for startups, the budget has provided plans in the taxes.
In order to make him realize his dream, the government has decided to establish an entrepreneurial hub.
The youth of the country should be able to face global challenges and should get opportunities in education .
These institutes will be provided financial aid as well.
This is a great initiative in educations sector.
Once there will be an environment of competition among higher education institutes, you can imagine what impact will it bring.
Primary education is equally important.
Traders and professionals who are facing such problems should be made free from it.
Equity means that national commitments must be consistent with the carbon space nations occupy.
We also need a strong Agreement on Adaptation and Loss and Damage.
Ultimately, for success, moderating our lifestyle is necessary, and possible, for a low carbon future.
The presence of 196 countries tells us that we have a chance to unite behind a common purpose.
We will succeed if we have the wisdom and courage to craft a genuinely collective partnership that balances responsibilities and capabilities with aspirations and needs.
I am confident that we will.
“Successful launch of IRNSS-1F is an accomplishment we all take immense pride in.

Thank you for coming out in strength on a Sunday.
Reid Hoffman, your LinkedIn is a great product.
And, you are an inspiration to many here and in India.
Thank you, Mohan, Venkie, Ambassador.
It is a great pleasure to be here.
For me, this is a special event, because the idea of startups is close to my heart.
The course of human history and progress has been shaped by imagination, inspiration, invention and innovation.
I often say, if there’s a strong wind blowing, some might want to shut the window.
Others will want to put up a windmill or launch their sails on the seas.
Start Ups have always been the engine of progress.
The mega corporations of today were Startsup of yesterday.
What is different now is that the digital age has created a fertile new environment for Startups.
This is a world in which you don’t grow by extracting resources, but by spreading an idea.
More than the creator, it is the consumer, who discovers applications.
Today, the Startups defy the natural rates of growth.
An idea can become a global name within a year.
The convergence of technology, integration across diverse fields, distributed architecture and people willing to back an idea, have opened a new world for enterprise.
This ecosystem was born in the Silicon Valley.
No community is shaping our world as much as the one on this Californian Coast.
It isn’t just big names, but small firms that are fashioning every day new ways to enrich human life with the joy of artists and creators.
That underlines America’s success and inspires the world.
So, I see Startups, technology and innovation as exciting and effective instruments for India’s transformation, and for creating jobs for our youth.
We are a nation of 800 million youth below the age of 35 years.
When each of the five hundred odd towns produces ten Startups and each of our six hundred thousand villages produce six small businesses, on a regular basis, we will create an enormous economic momentum and generate a huge number of jobs in our country.
India’s own ecosystem of startups is evolving rapidly.
It is driven by the energy, enterprise and innovation of our youth.
We have a huge market with rapid growth and untapped opportunities in every sector.
We now have the institutions, incentives and interest for new ventures.
We have incubators, accelerators and investors willing to back an idea and assume risks.
India has woken up to the potential of Startup Ventures with great enthusiasm and energy.
In the past few years, they have grown exponentially.
We have here an outstanding group of Startups from India.
They are applying technology to transform healthcare, education, agriculture, clean energy, security, financial inclusion of the poor and access to clean water.
Our Startups represent not just commercial success stories, but are powerful examples of social innovation.
The pace at which people in India are taking to digital technology defies our stereotypes of age, education, language and income.
We cannot simply continue on the traditional paths to development.
Startups will have an important role in achieving our vision.
From creating infrastructure to providing services, from manufacture of products to human resource development, from supporting governments to enabling citizens and promoting digital literacy, Digital India is a vast cyber world of opportunities for you.
I see Startups, not as short term investments, but as long term commitments.
Our application and enterprise is limited only by our imagination.
We have here today our Department of Space that provides free data on its portal.
In the course of past few months, we have put together 170 applications of space technology in governance and development.
Many of these could become the vehicles of new ventures in India.
But, it is not just about the opportunities generated on the digital platform and advanced science by urban enterprises.
I want to see the idea and the spirit of Startups light up the economies and the fortunes of people in rural India.
From handicrafts to tourism, the frontiers of possibilities and the scale of reach in India is immense.
They transform not only our rural economy, but also our society.
Our development models speak of Public Sector and Private Sector.
That is why I focused on Startup India in the Independence Day Address this year.
We are launching schemes that will support our mission.
And, I assure you that they won’t trap your creativity in long government procedures.
One is the Atal Innovation Mission, after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji to promote innovation.
We are also setting up Electronics Development Fund to support design, development and launch of new products.
We are reforming our regulations and processes, and making it easier to start and do business in India.
We are making our digital infrastructure and services accessible and affordable that will also bring broadband to six hundred thousand villages, and free Wi Fi to schools, universities and public places.
We are also giving the highest importance to data privacy and security, intellectual property rights and cyber security.
So, Make in India, Skill India and Design India will create a surge of opportunities.
So, friends, as we thought of Startups, it was natural to choose Silicon Valley for our first overseas event.
For, India and the United States have a natural partnership of innovation and technology that has shaped the knowledge economy.
I am told thatIndians account for 15% of startups here.
Hundreds of thousands of Indian professionals here and in India are contributing to the global success of U.S. enterprises.
Many are leading them today.
Our universities, labs and firms are working together for next generation advanced bio fuels, solar energy and energy efficiency.
Young Stanford scholars are teaming up with Indian counterparts in Delhi to make affordable biomedical devices for rural India.
We have here with us Manu Prakash, a young Indian scientist in Stanford, who has a lab to his name at the university.
This is the power of our cooperation and collaboration.
Sitting here, you can touch the life of a young child in a remote village.
I also hope that a young girl in a small town in India will look at the exhibitors today and dream of her own project.
And, someone in Mumbai or the Bay Area will be the angel to her dreams.
This is the possibility of the digital bridge – to connect distant lives and change fortunes and future.
This is the potential of youth and innovation.
It can ignite a partnership between India and the United States, which can advance prosperity in our two countries and give new content to our strategic partnership.
I am delighted to see so many new partnerships formed today.
I know you will succeed on the strength of your genius and enterprise.
But, when you need a helping hand, or when you find hurdles in your way, we will be there for you.
Let me thank NASSCOM, Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and TiE Silicon Valley for this very special event.

To those working in the start-up movement or are planning to start one after College, please do remember that the biggest corporations of today were start-ups of yesterday.
They were the result of idealism combined with hard-work and diligence.
Keep at it, do not give up, and you will succeed.
You are fortunate to have lived in a campus like this, in a city like Mumbai.
You have a lake on one side, and the hills too.
Occasionally, you share your campus with crocodiles and leopards.
It is still August, but I am sure the mood is indigo today!
I am sure the last four years were a wonderful learning experience for you all.
From different states, speaking different languages, from different backgrounds, you merge here in pursuit of knowledge and learning.
Innovations and Enterprise are going to be the foundation stone for making India a developed economy.
A long term sustainable technology-led economic growth is possible on this foundation.
Innovation is the buzzword of the 21st century.
Any society that does not innovate will stagnate.
That India is a emerging as a hub for start-ups shows that the thrust for innovation is very much there.
And, this will not happen through Government efforts alone.
It will happen through youngsters like you.
The best ideas do not come in Government buildings or in fancy offices.
They come in campuses like yours, in the minds of youngsters like you.
My appeal to you and many other youngsters like you is: Innovate in India, Innovate for humanity.

Honourable President, Respected Vice President, Madam Speaker of Lok Sabha, our Former Prime Minister Shri Devegowdaji, Members of the Council of Ministers, all the other members of the House, and the esteemed conglomerate gathered here representing diverse sectors.
In the process of nation building, we often arrive at a moment which leads us to a path breaking juncture and opens up a plethora of opportunities imploring us to aspire for new dreams.
At the stroke of the midnight hour today, together we shall ensure a pioneering future of the nation.
Within a few moments from now, our nation will embark upon a new economic regime.
The entire 1.25 billion citizens of the country are a witness to this historical event.
I do not believe that this process of GST is restricted to the scope of economy only.
We are honoured to be sitting in the same sanctum.
Let us reminisce the 9th of December, 1946 when this same Central Hall witnessed the first meeting to discuss the country’s Constitution.
The same House which once on 14 August, 1947, at the stroke of the midnight hour, witnessed the most pious moment of the nation attaining freedom!
On 26th November, 1949, this House stands as a testimony to the historical event when the Constitution was accepted by the nation.
But with diligence and hard work we can accomplish a task.
Chanakya had said that
If we take into consideration the 29 states, the 7 Union Territories, the 7 taxes of the Centre and the 8 taxes of the states, and several different taxes for different commodities, the number of taxes sum up to a figure of 500!
Today all those taxes will be shred off to have ONE NATION, ONE TAX right from Ganganagar to Itanagar and from Leh to Lakshadweep.
I was wondering if he was present here then how he would have reacted looking at the plethora of taxes.
And we have seen that usually there is not much of a difference in the quantity of production.
But when the product goes out, we can see the inequality due to different tax regimes of different states.
The same product will have different prices in, say Delhi , Gurugram and Noida which are 25-30 kilometres apart.
This is because Haryana , Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have different tax regimes.
Today we are moving ahead to get rid of that situation.
Arun Ji has vividly explained that once GST is in place, all sorts of taxes like sales tax, VAT etc. will cease to exist.
Today we are getting rid of all that.
The country is moving a step forward towards a modern taxation system.
It will help us curbing black money and corruption and reward honesty.
It will generate interest and enthusiasm to do business honestly.
It will bring in a new culture of governance.
Traders with a turnover up to Rs. 20 lakh are totally exempt from this.
Traders with a turnover up to Rs. 75 lakh are also having many exemptions.
In fact, the system is for the welfare of the poor.
Even after 70 years of independence, we have not been able to deliver to the poor.
It’s not that efforts were not made.
I request those who have fears to dismiss them.
It also boosts the exports of the country.
This system not only provides impetus to already developed states but also provides the opportunity to the backward states to develop.
Our states are enriched with natural resources – look at Bihar, eastern UP, West Bengal, the north east, Odisha.
They are all brimming with natural resources.
When they will get a single tax regime I can see clearly that whatever deficiency is there those will be removed and this art of the country will move ahead.
All the states of India will get equal opportunity for development.
In 2022, India will celebrate the Diamond Jubilee year of achieving Freedom.
We have embarked upon a journey to create a New India.
The New India which is the dream of our 1.25 billions Indians!
Therefore Ladies and Gentlemen, GST shall play a key role in helping us build the India of our dreams.
On this momentous occasion, I wish to acknowledge the role of the Honourable President who anchored the project concomitantly.
He has astutely engaged himself at every stage of the designing of this taxation reform and steered the team with his invaluable contribution towards this historical day.
His inspiration kept everyone enthused throughout the journey.
I am deeply indebted to him for his guidance and his august presence during the launch event of GST.
With new vigour and fervour we shall take the nation towards exemplary economic development.

Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said that the ideology propounded by Sufi saints is an integral part of Indian ethos, and has contributed significantly to the creation of a pluralistic, multi-cultural society in India.
In his remarks during a meeting with a delegation of 40 Barelvi Sufi Scholars from various parts of the country this evening, the Prime Minister said that forces of extremism are attempting to weaken the Sufi ideology today.

Expressing concern that certain forces do not wish the Muslim community of India to keep good relations with the Prime Minister, they said that so far, the divisive politics of vote-banks has resulted in the Muslim community interacting with the Government only through intermediaries; but now they want the Prime Minister to establish direct contact with the people of India, including the Muslims.
They urged the Prime Minister to work towards development of people which is irrespective of caste, community or religion.
The delegation members said that the spread of terrorism in the name of Islam, represents a danger to peace all over the world, and there is urgent need to take action to marginalize the forces which are promoting “Jihad” for social, economic or political considerations.
They added that there is need to spread awareness among the Muslim community that organizations such as the ISIS and Al-Qaeda, do NOT represent the path of Islam.

The implementation was delayed due to the monsoon.
It did not happen this time and there has not been any lag period after March.
It has also provided three months additional time for the completion of infrastructure projects.
• According to the estimates from Controller General of Accounts, the expenditure in April-June this year has been 30% more than the same time previous year.
• Capital Expenditure in Infrastructure related projects has gone up by 48% over the previous year.
• The trend of expenditure in the schemes reflects that the funds allocated would be spent in a balanced manner throughout the year.
Earlier, the expenditure used to begin after the monsoon and unnecessary pressure was there to spend the money before March.
It was one of the reasons for the faults in the system.
Floods in North Eastern States
• Incessant rains in many parts of the country and the floods in the north eastern states has been a cause of concern.
Many Central Government agencies are engaged in flood rescue and relief operations.
State Governments have been told to inform urgently whenever they need any assistance.
The Government will ensure that the perpetrators of this attack are brought to book.
• We are fully committed to maintain peace in Jammu and Kashmir and to wipe out the anti national elements from the state.
The Government is trading the path laid down by Atal ji.
State Governments must act tough on those inciting violence in the name of Cow protection
• It has an impact on the image of the nation.
State Governments must deal sternly against such anti-social elements.
• Cow is revered as the mother in our country.
Public sentiments are attached with the cow.
• All the political parties should condemn strongly this goondaism in the name of cow protection.
Acting against corruption
• Over the past few decades, the image of political leadership has been at crossroads due to the deeds of some of the leaders amongst us.
We need to convince the people that every leader is not tainted and every leader is not only running after money.
• What is required that we have to be transparent in our public life and yet there should be action against corrupt leaders.
• The onus lies on the political parties to identify such leaders among them and segregate them from their political journey.
• If the law of the land is working, then we have to join hands together ward off the challenge from those who try to save themselves by raking up the issue of political conspiracy.
• Nation will not gain anything by standing with those who have plundered the nation.
• 75th anniversary of uit India Movement falls on 9th August .
Parliament should discuss it.
• It would have been better had the Presidential election been held by consensus.
However, it is a matter of satisfaction and pride that the election campaign has been a dignified one.
All the political parties need to be congratulated.
He asked, “Do you have pictures of your own Northeast visits or glimpses of the spectacular natural beauty of the region?”
He requested the people to share them on Instagram using #MagnificentNortheast.
Madam Lagarde, My Cabinet colleague Shri Jaitley, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I warmly welcome you all to India and to Delhi.
I am sure, the IMF will be able to build on this success.
Reform of global institutions has to be an on-going process.
It must reflect changes in the global economy, and the rising share of emerging economies.
Even now, IMF quotas do not reflect the global economic realities.
Change in quotas is not an issue of increasing the ‘power’ of certain countries.
It is an issue of fairness and legitimacy.
The belief that quotas can be changed, is essential for the fairness of the system.
For poor nations to respect the legitimacy of such institutions, they must be able to aspire and to hope.
I am, therefore, very happy that the IMF has decided to finalize the next round of quota changes by October 2017.
I am happy to announce a new partnership with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, India and the IMF.
We have agreed to set up the South Asia Regional Training and Technical Assistance Centre.
The centre will provide training to government and public sector employees.
It will enhance their skills and improve the quality of their policy inputs.
It will also provide technical assistance to governments and public institutions.
Let me now turn to the theme of this conference.
Why is Asia so important, and how can India contribute?
Many knowledgeable people have said that the twenty first century is, and will be, the Asian Century.
Three out of every five people in the world live in Asia.
Its share in global output and trade is now close to one-third.
Its share in global foreign direct investment is about forty percent.
It has also been one of the world’s most dynamic regions.
Although Asia has slowed down, it is still growing at a rate three times greater than that of the advanced countries.
It is, therefore, the ray of hope for global economic recovery.
When we think about Asia, we must recognize that it is distinct in many ways.
For example, the theme of this conference is ‘Investing for the Future’.
Asian Families tend naturally to save more than people in other parts of the world.
Asians tend to save to buy a house, rather than borrow to buy a house.
Many Asian countries have relied more on developmental financial institutions and banks than on capital markets.
This provides an alternative model for the financial sector.
Social stability built on strong family values is another feature of Asia’s development.
Asians tend to leave things behind for the next generation.
Madam Lagarde, you are one of the world’s top women leaders.
You will be interested in another unique feature of Asia which is rarely commented upon: which is, the large number of women leaders.
India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, Myanmar, and Philippines: All of these countries have had women as national leaders.
Asia has done so to a much greater degree than other continents.
Today, four large states of India – West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Rajasthan – are headed by democratically elected women.
It also demonstrated clearly that the sense of nationhood, could be broad and inclusive.
It need not be defined by narrow linguistic or religious identities.
The Sanskrit saying “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” – the world is one family – refers to this sense of the oneness of all identities.
India has dispelled the myth that democracy and rapid economic growth cannot go together.
India’s growth rate of over seven per cent is being achieved in a country that is also a vibrant democracy.
It is sometimes assumed that democracy is a colonial gift to India.
But historians tell us that India had produced forms of democratic self governance, many centuries ago, when democracy was unknown in many parts of the world.
India has also shown that a large, diverse country can be managed in a way that can promote economic growth and maintain social stability.
One way in which we are doing this is through cooperative and competitive federalism.
The states and the Centre come together to pursue common objectives.
States which pursue good policies and deliver essential services for the poor, induce others to follow.
Our rapid economic growth is also very distinct in Asia.
We have never tried to gain in trade at the expense of our partners.
We do not follow “beggar thy neighbour” macro-economic policies.
We have never undervalued our exchange rate.
We add to world and Asian demand by running current account deficits.
We are therefore good Asian and good global economic citizens, and a source of demand to our trading partners.
I firmly believe that India can contribute to Asian prosperity and development by being economically strong.
Amid global problems, I am happy to say that India is a haven of macro-economic stability and a beacon of hope, dynamism and opportunity.
Madam Lagarde, you have referred to India as the “bright spot” in the global economy.
I view this as a great privilege and, at the same time, a major responsibility.
Let me outline our achievements in the last few months and our priorities for the period ahead.
We have achieved major gains in macro-economic stability.
A durable reduction in inflation, steady fiscal consolidation, a comfortable balance of payments position and build-up of foreign exchange reserves are the highlights.
In a difficult external environment and despite a second successive year of weak rainfall, we have increased our growth rate to 7.6 per cent, the highest among major economies in the world.
We have improved our economic governance.
Corruption and interference in the decisions of banks and regulators are now behind us.
I am very happy to note that all our colleagues have expressed one voice and one sentiment.
Today, when we talk of Jammu & Kashmir, we should talk about four parts of the State of Jammu & Kashmir: Jammu, Kashmir Valley, Ladakh, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
I am thankful to leaders of all political parties for the concerns they have expressed about the current situation in parts of Jammu & Kashmir.
The rich traditions nurtured by our democracy for last six decades have been the biggest strength of unity and integrity of our country.
We may have some differences on some issues but when it comes to the integrity and sovereignty of the country, we all stand united.
Like every Indian, I have been deeply hurt by the recent incidents in Jammu & Kashmir.
The poor are the worst affected by this situation.
Our existence as political workers is on account of the people.
They are our strength, our source of energy; In fact, people’s power is a vital part of our public life.
Irrespective of whether a civilian or security force personnel is injured or killed, the pain is felt by all of us.
I express deep sympathies to their families.
We have an open mind and our doors are always open.
We are committed to the welfare of every citizen of the entire State of Jammu & Kashmir.
We have been following the path shown by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji to find a solution.
Jammu & Kashmir is often called the crown of India.
In fact, Jammu & Kashmir is a symbol of the age old commitment of equanimity towards all creeds (sarv-panth sambhaav), where Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Muslims have been living together for centuries.
The state of Jammu & Kashmir is the symbol of our founding fathers’ faith which defines us as Indian in spite of our diversity.
Despite this, our security forces have shown restraint.
Statistics reveal that security personnel have been injured in large numbers.
Every Kashmiri wants peace, has faith in Democracy.
That is why, despite threats by separatist elements during every election, the Kashmiri people have expressed faith in the Indian democratic system in each election (festival of Indian democracy).
Even just prior to the recent disturbances, high votes were cast in the constituency of Chief Minister Mehbooba ji.
Therefore, to spread the myth that this is a public agitation is far from the truth.
Due to terrorism normal life in Kashmir Valley is affected.
Since the start of Terrorist activities in Kashmir in 1989-1990, in action by the Security Forces:
• More than 34,000 AK 47 Rifles were seized.
• More than 5000 Grenade launchers were seized.
• Around 90 LMGs were seized.
• More than 12,000 Revolvers were seized.
• 3 Anti Tank Guns and 4 Anti Aircraft Guns were seized.
• More than 350 Missile Launchers were seized.
• 63,000 kilograms of explosives including RDX and more than one lakh Grenades were seized.
• During this period more than 5,000 foreign terrorists were killed which is almost equal to the strength of 5 Battalions.
When weapons have been seized in such huge numbers, so many foreign terrorists have infiltrated to spread death and destruction, the world will never accept the false propaganda of Pakistan, even if it speaks a hundred thousand lies.
Pakistan forgets that it bombs its own citizens using fighter planes.
The time has come when Pakistan shall have to answer to the world for the atrocities committed by it against people in Baluchistan and PoK.
We are fully committed to the fundamental rights of the people.
Our anti-terror laws are more humane than those of any other democracy in the world.
Our governments and our security forces have shown restraint in dealing with these incidents.
India will fight against terrorism with full might and resolve.
This is our national duty.
For us, ‘means and ends’ are both important and we are sufficiently capable in both these regards.
This package not only has proposals for roads and electricity projects, it actually envisages development of every region and every section of society of Jammu and Kashmir.
This includes better facility for education of children, employment to youths, modern facility for treatment, facilities for promotion of tourism in the state and special arrangements for production of fruits in the State.
In order to provide employment immediately, the government has decided that 10 thousand Special Police Officers (SPOs), about 1200 Para Military and about 4000 candidates in 5 IR battalions will be recruited.
In addition, about 1 lakh 25 thousand (125,000) persons will be trained under Udaan and HIMAYAT schemes so that unemployed people can get appropriate employment.
The whole nation stands with her.
We will deal strictly with acts of violence, terrorism and anti India activities.
At the same time, genuine grievances of every person will be heard and addressed.
I would like to reiterate that all the political parties and all Indians will have to stand united in the fight against terrorism and destructive forces.
All political parties will have to bury their differences and cooperate to restore peace and prosperity in the state.
I fully believe that with the active efforts of the state government and with your full cooperation, we will be able to restore normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir very soon.
I would like to reiterate our main steps and our policy in respect of Kashmir:
1) It is the duty of any Government to maintain law and order.
3) We will take forward the political process, in accordance with democratic traditions.
They have also been a strong driver of economic and people to people connectivity between our two countries.Prime Minister Najib and I had jointly inaugurated the Torana Gate in Kuala Lumpur during my last visit.
Modelled on the Torana Gates of the Sanchi Stupa this stands as a symbol of our abiding friendship.
Malaysian companies are participating in many of our infrastructure projects across different states in India.
I am confident that the business partnerships that they forge will enhance the level and momentum of our commercial engagement.
We are also converging efforts aimed at food security that are linked to the wellbeing of our farmers.
The MOU on proposed development of a fertiliser plant in Malaysia and off-take of surplus urea from Malaysia to India is a welcome development.
The signing today of the MOU on Mutual Recognition of Degrees is a landmark development that will benefit the students and societies of both our countries.
Excellency, your own leadership in countering radicalization and terrorism is an inspiration for the entire region.
Our wide-ranging defence partnership has already brought our armed forces closer.
We are cooperating in:
I am confident that our decisions today will drive our strategic partnership to the next level.
I wish you an enjoyable and fruitful stay in India.

Honourable Jayalalithaa ji, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,
Today is indeed a special day.
Today, Excellency Putin and I have the honour to dedicate Kudankulam nuclear power plant unit-1.
I am particularly grateful to President Putin for his presence at this event.
And, I am delighted that Jayalalithaa ji, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu is also present with us on this occasion.
In dedicating Kudankulam 1, we mark another historic step in India-Russia relations.
Its successful completion is not just another fine example of the strength of our special and privileged Strategic Partnership.
It is also a celebration of our abiding friendship.
And, it is only a start of our collaboration in this field.
It is perhaps not commonly known that at 1000 Mega Watt, Kudankulam 1 is the largest single unit of electrical power in India.
In years ahead, we are determined to pursue an ambitious agenda of nuclear power generation.
At Kudankulam alone, five more units of 1000 Mega Watt each are planned.
In our journey of cooperation, we plan to build a series of bigger nuclear power units.
Today’s event is also a joyful occasion for the team of Indian and Russian engineers, scientists and technicians.
We salute their dedication and hard work and congratulate them for the fruits of their labour.
The story of human development has been of wide spread technological advancement and growing economic prosperity.
But, as we all know, it has not been without burden on our environment.
I have a vision for India where achievements of our economic development are respectful to mother earth.
And, where the engines of our industrial growth are increasingly driven by clean energy.
Kudankulam 1 is an important addition to India’s continuing efforts to scale up production of clean energy in India.
It also signals our joint commitment to build pathways of partnership for green growth.
The success of our joint efforts in nuclear power generation is a proud achievement of our cooperation.
It demonstrates our common resolve to keep our ties firm and steady.
Above all, it showcases your personal commitment, consistent support and strong leadership in transforming the substance and character of our relationship.
For this, I am grateful to you Mr. President.
The people of India associate naturally and with great ease with the people of your great country.
And, personally, I have always deeply valued our friendship.
It is, therefore, only fitting that today we join together to dedicate the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant Unit-1 to the strength and vigour of our friendship and cooperation.
Long live Indo-Russian friendship!
I once again thank you Excellency Putin for joining me in this dedication.
Also, my sincere thanks to Jayalalithaa ji for being with us.

President Kenyatta and the people of Kenya received me with great warmth and genuine affection.
And, today I am delighted to welcome President Kenyatta and his delegation in India.
The close association between our two countries is, of course, much older.
India and Kenya fought together against colonialism.
Common belief in democratic values, our shared developmental priorities and the warm currents of the Indian Ocean bind our societies.
In our discussions today, President and I reviewed the full range of our relationship.
During my visit to Kenya last year, we had identified deepening of economic cooperation as one of the key focus areas of our efforts.
In this context, expansion of bilateral trade, greater flow of capital between two economies, and stronger developmental partnership are a priority.
Long term arrangement with Kenya for production and import of pulses is being explored and discussed.
We would also be happy to share best practises in organic farming with Kenyan farmers.
In the health sector, Bhabhatron machine has been delivered to the Kenyatta National Hospital for cancer treatment.
The challenges in the Maritime domain are a shared concern.
Some of the specific areas of priority would be hydrography, communications networks, anti-piracy, capacity building, exchanges and defence medical cooperation.
We are also partnering to strengthen our security cooperation and capacities.
The large Indian-origin community of Kenya is a vital and energetic link between us.
I have discussed with President Kenyatta ways to engage them with our trade, investments and cultural exchanges.
In our meeting last year, President and I had also agreed to accord close and personal supervision of the implementation of our decisions.
We need to ensure its continuing rigour .
Once again, on behalf of the people of India and on my own behalf, I thank you for accepting our invitation and honouring us with your presence, both in Gujarat and in Delhi.

Gentlemen present on the dais and brothers & sisters of Pune now gathered here in large numbers.
Quality works have to be done in villages with generation of job opportunities.
Villages should get the same facilities, potentials and avenues available in cities.
Only then we will be able to check the exodus of population from villages to cities.
On the other hand piece meal thinking with targeted comeback in elections after five years will leave us as a loser on the front of overcoming the challenges mounting ahead of cities.
This Rurban mission has a clear object of an urbanised village with a Rural soul.
The spirit of village should not die.
So, in order to reduce pressure on cities we have focussed on such hundreds of villages across the country and have tried to enhance facilities under the Rurban Mission.
On the other hand Infrastructure is the first and foremost requirement to bring changes in cities.
Till now there has been callous attitude towards Infrastructure development in our country.
This is sufficient for now so make only a small road.
In later stage when the road has to be widened, there comes encroachment on its side by persons residing there.
This leads to court cases and matter is kept in store for another 25-30 years.
This has been the practice.
This indicates that we have not cared for future requirements and opted that kind of development model which gives only short term gains.
You can imagine the magnitude of burden we have decided to bear.
So it is our resolve to take projects in hand in such a manner that it should be complete in the given time frame.
So if possible, effort should be to plan for things that are estimated to be required after 25-30 years.
Today this approach may not be economically viable but ones the process takes off, we will also learn getting economically viable.
We want to bring chances in quality of life.
Today a Herculean task of connecting 2.5 lakh panchayats through Optical Fibre Network in the country is underway.
There was a time when infrastructure was taken as road, rail or to a maximum airport was taken into thought.
For I-Way we need Optical Fibre connectivity throughout the country.
I feel lucky in being with you now.
How happy Mr. Jagtap ji is feeling now, I don’t know.
It is very difficult to express ones happiness if arising out of political factors.
Just now Venkaiah ji said that Pune is getting 160 crore rupees instead of 28 crore rupees.
On the eve of elections, if a municipality have 160 crore in its coffers, what can not be done?
Brothers and sisters I have special expectations from Pune.
This is a city of our country with industrial heritage.
This is an educational hub also.
Now Aadhaar services have also been enabled.
Only Aadhaar number, account number and your thumb impression are enough for payment now.
So is with the currency notes, more notes less value and finally no value.
Before 8th November there was no taker for 100 rupee note.
And my fight is for raising the strength of small persons and empowerment of poor.
But you might have seen earlier instances.
Later we are all the way.
Brothers and sisters these steps have been taken after well planning and thinking and keeping the interests of countrymen and I hope we will succeed, the country will succeed.
Metro work should start at fast pace.
When Maharashtra elections were going on, I had said that for 15 years this vehicle of Maharashtra is stuck in a ditch, bailing it out of that will need double engine.
One from Delhi and other one from Maharashtra Government.
It will facilitate exchange of technical experts, reports and technical documents, training and seminars/ workshops focusing on specific technology areas and other interactions for knowledge sharing.
2. Co-operation in setting up of latest railway R&D facilities in India;
3. Planning and execution of Technical seminar or forum;
4. Short Term Training Programme for RDSO personnel by KRRI;
5. Exchange Programme of Personnel between KRRI & RDSO for limited period, for specific Projects;
6. Consultancy for the development of railway industry of both the countries; and
7. Any other form of cooperative activities agreed upon by the Parties.

It will further promote understanding of the best practices in the areas of food safety in both countries and in faster resolution of issues related to food safety.
Shri Ramnath Kovind, Governor of Bihar,
Venerable MING KUANG SHI from Taiwan,
Venerable THICH THIEN TAM from Vietnam,
Venerable TELO TULKU RINPOCHE from Russia,
Venerable Banagala Upatissa from Sri Lanka,
My Ministerial colleague Shri Kiren Rijiju,
Minister Lyonpo Namgay Dorji of Bhutan,
Minister Bayarsaikhan of Mongolia,
Venerable members of the Maha Sanga, visiting Ministers and Diplomats from foreign countries,
I am very happy to be in the midst of all of you.
I feel very blessed to be here at Bodh Gaya.
After Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, I have the opportunity to visit this sacred place.
I am meeting you all on a very special day.
Today, we in India are observing Teachers’ Day, to commemorate the birth anniversary of our 2nd President, a great scholar and teacher, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.
In this symposium we have been talking about one of the most impactful teachers in world history, Gautama Buddha.
His teachings have inspired millions of people over centuries.
The world has so much to learn from Lord Krishna.
When we talk about Lord Krishna we say, श्री कृष्णम वंदे जगतगुरुम -Shri Krishna, the teacher of all teachers; the Guru of all Gurus.
Both, Gautama Buddha and Lord Krishna have taught the world so much.
The themes of this conference, in a way are inspired by the values and ideals given by these two greats.
Both of them gave great prominence to principles and processes.
These two divine souls had the strength to bring people together, rising above differences.
Their teachings are most practical, eternal and are more relevant in this day and age than ever before.
The place where we are meeting makes it even more special.
We are meeting in Bodh Gaya, a land that has a distinctive place in the history of humankind.
This is, therefore the ideal venue for a dialogue and meeting here on the auspicious day of Janmashtami and the special day of Teachers’ Day makes this unique.
It was my great privilege to have participated in the Inaugural function of the first International Hindu Buddhist Initiative on “Conflict Avoidance and Environmental Consciousness” hosted by the Vivekananda International Foundation and Tokyo Foundation with the support of the International Buddhist Confederation at Delhi day before yesterday.
The Conference was conceptualised on shifting the paradigm from conflict resolution to conflict avoidance and from environmental regulation to environmental consciousness.
I had shared some of my thoughts on the two critical themes which are threatening humanity as no other challenge before.
And other Buddhist nations have also offered to hold similar conferences in their countries.
This is an extraordinary development which coincides with the rise of Asia as an economic and civilisational phenomenon.
The two day conference seems to have arrived at a broad consensus on both issues.
On the issue of environment, the conference seems to have agreed that the philosophic underpinning of the Dharma, which stresses the protection of natural heritage, is critical for sustainable development.
I may add that the United Nations too has arrived at the view that sustainable development is achievable only through aligning development to the local culture of the people.
This, in my view, is a positive turn in the development modelling of the world of diversity.
I may add that the turn in thinking at the global level has created the eco-system for the Hindu-Buddhist societies to carry forward their consensual ideas to the global fora.
Hindu philosophy was one of the greatest beneficiaries of the advent and the teachings of the Lord Buddha.
Many scholars have analysed the impact of Buddha on Hinduism.
That was the extent of influence of the Buddha on Adi Sankara, regarded by many as the tallest Hindu philosopher.
At the mass level Buddha was so venerated that Jayadeva in his Geeta Govinda even praised him as Mahavishnu or God himself who descended to preach Ahimsa.
So, Hinduism after the Buddha’s advent became Buddhist Hinduism or Hindu Buddhism.
They are today an inseparable amalgam.
Buddha never bowed down to anything, neither Veda, nor caste, nor priest, nor custom.
Buddha was the first human being to give to this world a complete system of morality.
Every man and woman has the same right to attain spirituality— that was his teaching.
When this highest tribute is paid by one of the great Hindu philosophers would it be wrong to call today’s Hinduism in quality and substance as Buddhist Hinduism?
Buddha is the crown jewel of the Indian Nation which accepts all ways of worship of all religions.
This quality of Hinduism in India was a product of many great spiritual masters chief among them was Buddha.
And this is what sustains the secular character of India.
The Enlightenment which Buddha attained in Bodh Gaya also lit the light of enlightenment in Hinduism.
We in India would like to develop Bodh Gaya so that it can become the spiritual capital and civilisational bond between India and the Buddhist world.
The government of India would like to provide all possible support that its Buddhist cousin nations need for the satisfaction of their spiritual needs from this holiest of holy places for them.
I am happy to read the Declaration of Buddhist Religions and Spiritual Leaders.
I also echo Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who the other day highlighted the importance of tolerance, appreciation of diversity, and spirit of compassion and fraternity.
His message to this august gathering and his continuous support for furthering this initiative is a matter of great strength for us.
Once again, my congratulations and best wishes to you all.
This conference has raised a hope and urge to go beyond clash and create a dialogue framework for civilizational harmony and world peace.
I wish you well in your constant and determined efforts to ensure that our wisdom reaches the future generations and that too in a manner in which they can practically relate to.
This is essential not for us or them but for the progress of the entire human race and the beautiful surroundings which we have got from Mother Nature.

I wish to thank the Chief Minister, Siddharamaih ji, and his entire government for his assistance and efforts in organizing this event and making it a big success.
It is my particular pleasure to welcome Excellency the Prime Minister of Portugal, the Vice President of Suriname, the honourable Ministers from Malaysia and Mauritius to the event.
Their achievements, the name they have earned in their own societies and globally, are a great inspiration for all of us.
It also reflects the success, glory and enterprise of Indian diaspora the world over.
There are over 30 million Overseas Indians living abroad.
Their footprint is all over the world.
But, Indians abroad are valued not just for their strength in numbers.
I have met and spoken to hundreds of thousands of our brothers and sisters during my travels abroad – in USA, UK, Australia, South Africa, UAE, Qatar, Singapore, Fiji, China, Japan, South Korea, Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles, Malaysia and other countries.
As a result of our sustained and systematic out-reach, there is new energy, keen desire and strong drive among Indian Diaspora to connect more extensively and deeply with India’s social and economic transformation The remittance of close to sixty nine billion dollars annually by the overseas Indians makes an invaluable contribution/ to the Indian economy.
NRIs and PIOs have made outstanding contributions to their chosen fields.
Among them, there are politicians of stature, scientists of repute, outstanding doctors, brilliant educationists, economists, musicians, famous philanthropists, journalists, bankers, engineers and lawyers.
And, sorry, did I mention our well known Information Technology professionals?
Friends, Irrespective of their background and profession, the welfare and safety of all Indians abroad is our top priority.
For this, we are strengthening the entire eco-system of our administrative arrangements.
The security of Indian nationals abroad is of utmost importance to us.
In situations of distress faced by Indian nationals, we have reached out to ensure their safety, rescue and repatriation.
Under Operation संकट मोचन in July 2016, we evacuated over one hundred and fifty Indian nationals from South Sudan within 48 hours.
Prior to that, we evacuated several thousands of our citizens from conflict situations in Yemen in well-coordinated, smooth and swift operations.
In the last two years – 2014-2016, we facilitated the repatriation of over ninety thousand Indian nationals from nearly 54 countries.
Through the Indian Community Welfare Fund we have assisted more than eighty thousand Indian nationals abroad/ who were in contingency situations.
Our aim is that for every Indian abroad, home should never be far away.
Online registration of foreign employers on e-Migrate portal has been made mandatory.
And, the grievances, complaints and petitions of the Indian migrant workers continue to be addressed online through e-Migrate and MADAD platforms.
We are also taking strict action against illegal recruitment agents in India.
We are aware of difficulties faced by Persons of Indian Origin from these countries in obtaining an OCI Card if they moved abroad four or five generations ago.
We acknowledge their concerns and have made efforts to address these issues.
I am glad to announce that starting with Mauritius, we are working to put in place new procedures and documentation requirements so that the descendants of Girmitiyas from this country could become eligible for OCI Cards.
We remain committed to addressing similar difficulties of PIOs in Fiji, Reunion Islands, Suriname, Guyana and other Caribbean States.
Under the scheme an overseas Indian can work for one to three months in an institution in India.
Friends, It is my firm belief that connect between India and over-seas Indians should be sustained and enriching for both.
I am confident that the Kendra will become another important platform for crystallizing ongoing efforts of the government to redefine its engagement with the over-seas Indian community.
To provide the young Indian-origin youth an opportunity to visit their motherland and reconnect with their Indian roots, culture, and heritage– we have expanded the Government’s Know India Program, under which for the first time, six groups of young over-seas Indians are visiting India this year.
I am very happy to know that 160 of these young over-seas Indians are here today to participate in the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
There are some amongst you who would like to contribute in business and investments.
Others may feel more comfortable supporting through contributions made to Swachh Bharat, Namami Gange and others.

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit the Sabarmati Ashram with him.
Today both of us visited the Dandi Kutir.
Mutual trust and faith, understanding of each other’s interests and concerns, and continuous high level interactions, this is the uniqueness of Indo-Japan relations.
Last year, during my visit to Japan, we had a historic agreement for peaceful use of nuclear energy.
I express my gratitude to the people of Japan, Parliament of Japan, and especially Prime Minister Abe for its ratification.
This agreement has added a new chapter to our cooperation on the issue of clean energy and climate change.
In 2016-17, India got Japanese investment worth $ 4.7 billion which is 80 percent more than the previous year.
Now Japan is the third largest investor in India.
It clearly shows how much confidence and optimism is prevalent in Japan towards India’s economic development and a golden tomorrow.
And by looking at this investment, it can be assumed that in the coming days people-to-people ties between India and Japan will grow further along with a growing business.
At the same time, I would also request the Japanese business community to open more Japanese restaurants in India!
Today, India is on the path of a radical change at many levels.
Whether it is ease of doing business or Skill India, taxation reforms or Make in India, India is transforming completely.
This is a huge opportunity for Japanese businesses.
And I’m glad that many Japanese companies are deeply involved with our flagship programs.
I am confident that our dialogue and the agreements signed by us today will further strengthen the partnership between India and Japan in all areas.
With these words, I once again warmly welcome Prime Minister Abe and the high level delegation accompanying him.
Arigato Gozaimas (Thank you)
